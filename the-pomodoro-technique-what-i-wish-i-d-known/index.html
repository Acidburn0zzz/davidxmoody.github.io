<h1>The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I&#x27;d known</h1>

<p>Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
<p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised this sooner. </p>

<h2 id="a-look-back">A look back</h2>
<p>I first tried the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> In June 2013. The idea is simple. Set a timer and focus on one task until it runs out. <strong>I absolutely loved it.</strong></p>
<p>When I first started, I needed a tool to time myself. I quickly found <a href="http://tomato.es/">Tomatoes</a>. It&#39;s a free and <a href="https://github.com/potomak/tomatoes">open source</a> web app. After a year of use, I&#39;m still pretty pleased with it. It does all the important stuff. It has a timer, audible alerts and the ability to visualise past performance. </p>
<p>If you are interested, here is a <a href="http://tomato.es/users/51bb385849f9a801320000ec">link to my Tomatoes profile</a>. I&#39;ve completed 702 tomatoes as of the time of writing. I am pleased with that but I know I could have done better. </p>
<p>The biggest &quot;problem&quot; is that I lacked consistency. My graph is nothing but a series of spikes. 8 tomatoes one day, 0 the next, 7 the next, 0 the next. I didn&#39;t realise why this was happening until recently. </p>
<h2 id="i-missed-the-most-important-part">I missed the most important part</h2>
<p>That brings me back to this blog post. While researching it, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Pragmatic-Life-ebook/dp/B00A376NI8">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</a>. It&#39;s a good book (although most of the information is available elsewhere too). </p>
<p>What was the reason for my inconsistent spikes? <strong>My planning sucked.</strong></p>
<p>I was having great success with the 25-5 cycle but that wasn&#39;t enough. I did not get into the habit of creating strong plans. I never prioritised enough or made them specific enough. This caused me to waste too much time on the wrong things. I felt like I was &quot;stuck&quot; and lost motivation to continue. </p>
<p>Here is a specific example. When I started putting together the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website, I spent ages struggling with the CSS. I tried to create my own responsive layout from scratch (with no previous experience doing similar things). It was really hard. I hated it and wanted to quit. Eventually, I realised that the reason I hated it was that I was working on the wrong thing. Perfectly aligned CSS was not important to the project as a whole. I ended up switching to Bootstrap and got on with making the site. </p>
<p>So, what should I have done? Basically, I should have followed the <em>actual</em> Pomodoro Technique much more closely. </p>
<ol>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Get stuff done and track it</li>
<li>Review daily progress</li>
</ol>
<p>I used to think that having Tomatoes track everything was good enough. I realise now that tracking is useless unless you look back at the data and process it. I&#39;m getting better at planning but still need to work on reviewing. </p>
<h2 id="tools-don-t-really-matter">Tools don&#39;t really matter</h2>
<p>It&#39;s obvious but also hard to internalise. I think everyone falls into the same trap. You think, &quot;Maybe this <em>next</em> todo app will make me more productive&quot;. But no, it never works like that. </p>
<p>The original Pomodoro Technique recommends sticking to the simplest tools possible. Just paper and a simple kitchen timer. I respect that now.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-matter-">What does matter?</h2>
<p>I think the most important part of the Pomodoro Technique (and of <em>any</em> productivity system) is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle</a>. That is, creating a prioritised plan, doing it, reviewing how it went and using that information to improve your next plan. </p>
<p>Having said that, I also really like the 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of rest cycle. I&#39;ve been using it for so long that I think I take it for granted. Taking frequent rests and focusing completely can build significant momentum. I&#39;ve just got to make sure I point that momentum in the right direction. </p>
<p>If you are interested in the Pomodoro Technique, I highly recommend it. This blog post is hardly meant to be a comprehensive introduction. The <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">official website</a> is a good place to get started. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Pragmatic-Life-ebook/dp/B00A376NI8">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</a> ebook is also very good. I also still like <a href="http://tomato.es/">Tomatoes</a>.</p>
