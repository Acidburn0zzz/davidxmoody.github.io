For my third Blinkist book summary, I chose [Influence](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/influence-en.html) by Robert B. Cialdini. 

I bought this book on Kindle about 4 years ago but only ever read the fist two or three chapters. I've always wanted to finish it since then and this was a good opportunity to see what else was in the book.

## Opening examples

Interesting opening example of female turkeys which, upon hearing a "cheap-cheap" sound, will automatically assume that the thing making it is their children. Even if it's actually a polecat with a tape recorder strapped to it. It's meant to illustrate that all animals have certain shortcut behaviours and humans are no exception.

The next example is when a gem store owner accidentally doubled the price of some jade rather than halving it. It quickly sold out. It's meant to highlight the fact that humans have the shortcut of: "price indicates quality". Even though it was still the same jewellery, people assumed it was better because it now cost more.
