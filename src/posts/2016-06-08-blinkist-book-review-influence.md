For my third Blinkist book summary, I chose [Influence](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/influence-en.html) by Robert B. Cialdini. 

I bought this book on Kindle about 4 years ago but only ever read the fist two or three chapters. I've always wanted to finish it since then and this was a good opportunity to see what else was in the book.

## Opening examples

Interesting opening example of female turkeys which, upon hearing a "cheap-cheap" sound, will automatically assume that the thing making it is their children. Even if it's actually a polecat with a tape recorder strapped to it. It's meant to illustrate that all animals have certain shortcut behaviours and humans are no exception.

The next example is when a gem-store owner accidentally doubled the price of some jade rather than halving it. It quickly sold out. It's meant to highlight the fact that humans have the shortcut of: "price indicates quality". Even though it was still the same jewellery, people assumed it was better because it now cost more.

## The rule of reciprocation

Humans feel like we have a duty to repay others in kind for whatever they have provided to us. If we do not repay a favour, it can feel like a psychological burden. 

To rid ourselves of this perceived debt, we are often willing to reciprocate with a much larger favour than the one originally received. 

To exploit this, you can offer a smaller favour and then ask for a larger favour in return. 

To protect against this, you can learn to recognise when a favour is genuine and when it is being used as an abusive tactic against you. In the latter case, you can simply refuse to fall for it.

Of course, you can also use this in a friendly manner. You can do something for someone which is easy for you to do but is worth a lot to them. 

The best example I can think of is to give honest and constructive feedback on something they have been working on. It only costs you a little bit of time but can be incredibly valuable to them. 

Similarly for knowledge sharing. If you know a lot more about one subject than someone else then you can give them advice or fix their problems more quickly than they could. They can then repay you by sharing something they know but you don't. 

## Rejection-then-retreat

1. Ask for something pretty big
2. They say no
3. Ask for something smaller
4. They say yes

This can be even more effective than just asking for the smaller thing first. It works because when you lower your request, you are making a *concession* to them. They feel obliged to make a similar concession to you by accepting your request.

Additionally, **the principle of contrast** will make your second request seem smaller/easier in comparison.

As an added bonus, they might even say yes to your first request.

## Scarcity!

People hate losing *opportunities*. If an opportunity is seen as limited in availability then it will be viewed as more valuable in comparison.

If information about the opportunity is limited then it can trigger the effect too.

It can be more effective when availability suddenly drops rather than when it has been low all along.

It can also be made even more effective if you think you are competing with others for the same limited resources.

To protect against this, you should ask yourself if you really want the thing for what it is or if you suddenly have an irrational desire to possess it. The latter case is often triggered by artificial scarcity.

As a general strategy for buying things and protecting myself against this, I keep a list of things I need/want. When I notice something has been hanging around on that list for 30+ days then it is probably something I actually need rather than a fake need created by marketing.

I recently visited booking.com to book a hotel and I noticed that they are playing this strategy to a *ridiculous degree*. Everywhere on their site they are trying to suggest that the hotel your are looking at is about to get booked up.

They tell you how many times other people have booked with that hotel today and how many rooms are left. They aren't even remotely subtle about it either. They show search results saying things like: "You missed it! We have reserved our last available room at this property." The most annoying part is that even though I knew exactly what they were doing, I still felt like I was getting strongly influenced by it.

## Banned things are more desirable

Again, humans hate losing opportunities so when something is banned, it can be seen as more desirable.

I suspect that the competition aspect is especially powerful here. If something is banned then other people might be less willing to take the risks to acquire it. But if you can get it and they don't, you might have an advantage over them.

## Consistency!

We have a strong desire to *appear consistent* in our words and actions.
