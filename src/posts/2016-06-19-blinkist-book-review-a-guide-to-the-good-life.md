This is my review/notes of [A Guide to the Good Life](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/a-guide-to-the-good-life-en.html) by William B. Irvine. It's a book about Stoicism.

The previous three book summaries I read were all packed full of specific tips and resulted in long blog posts. The next few I have read are all a bit shorter and dealt with more abstract concepts and messages rather than actionable bullet points. There is nothing wrong with that although I expect the next few to be much shorter and contain more of my own thoughts than the others.

## Philosophy of life

Having a philosophy of life can help us to reflect on what we really want in life. It can help us to articulate our goals better and make us less likely to regret our choices as we get older.

## Stoicism

Stoicism advocates a path of moderation between the extremes of hedonism and asceticism. It teaches you to appreciate physical pleasures and material possessions but not to let them control you.

There are two central values in Stoicism, virtue and tranquillity.

Being virtuous means leading the life we were created to live. I think it also means to make the most of the situations we find ourselves in. It requires reasoning and planning. It's also a long-term thing that requires effective and disciplined action.

Being tranquil means to be able to step back from your emotions and not let them control you.

## Learn to appreciate what we already have

Consumerism tries to make us always want the next big expensive thing. Because of hedonic adaptation, we tend to quickly get used to anything, no matter how luxurious it is. 

To fight the temptations of consumerism, we should learn to appreciate what we already have.

One tool to do this is called negative visualisation. It involves imagining what our lives would be like if something we have or someone we know was lost. 

Another tool is voluntary discomfort. We can choose to live without something we usually have for a while.

Both negative visualisation and voluntary discomfort help to do two things:

- They hardens us in case of actual loss
- They makes us appreciate things more while we still have them

As an example, consider food. If you are accustomed to eating lots of sugary high-calorie food, or if you are accustomed to eating at expensive restaurants then it can take a lot to satisfy you. However, if you have a more simple diet, you can gain much more enjoyment from simple things like an apple.

I guess the idea of intermittent fasting is related to this. It's something I've tried in the past but have never stuck with in the long run. I'm interested in trying again though. 

## What you can control

Broadly speaking, things fall into three categories:

1. External things you cannot control
2. Internal things you can control
3. Things which you have a limited amount of control over

Stoicism teaches us to learn to accept things that we cannot control and focus on the things that we can. 

Things we cannot control include other people's flaws and other people's opinions of us. Also external events like natural disasters, politics, death and the weather.

Things you can control include many of your internal actions and thoughts. Nobody can prevent you from being a more virtuous, generous or forgiving person.

The third category is things which you have influence over but not complete control. For example, when playing a game of table tennis against a skilled opponent, you cannot directly control whether you win or lose. 

What you can do in these situations is *internalise your goal* and focus on the aspects that you do control. In the table tennis example, you cannot control how well your opponent plays but you can control how well you play. If you focus on playing as well as you possibly can, you will often end up playing better than if you focus on winning the game. 

Of course, the third category is pretty complicated. Stephen Fry gives the analogy of our moods being like the weather. He says when it's raining, there is no point walking out in a t-shirt and expect not to get wet. Similarly when you are depressed, you can't do the things you normally do and expect it to be the same. He says that in the first case, you need to bring an umbrella and in the second, you need to adjust your actions accordingly. 

I like that analogy in some ways, however it does not account for the fact that we have a lot of indirect influence over our moods. Many things feed into our mood system. Some of them are external like our success at work and the happiness of our friends.

TODO work out the analogy above, it's not there yet



Another example is what to do when my internet connection becomes unreliable. I can either sit there turning my router off and on again and getting frustrated. Or I can accept that there really isn't anything I can do to make it better right now and move on to another activity.
