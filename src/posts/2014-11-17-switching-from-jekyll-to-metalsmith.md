title: Switching from Jekyll to Metalsmith
---

Over the last couple of days, I have completely rewritten the source for this blog. Jekyll has been good to me for the last three months. However, I found myself wanting more control. I also wanted to be able to write extensions in JavaScript rather than Ruby. 

This blog is now completely built by [Metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith). It's a very simple static site generator. It's really just a way to help manipulate directories of files. All the interesting stuff is done by plugins, of which there are plenty.


I wanted to publish this post today to stick to my schedule. However, I've been working so much on the transition to Metalsmith that I don't have time to write about it today. 

I'm planning to write a multi-part series on the transition. I will then write about customising my blog further. I may even get on to publishing my own Metalsmith plugins or contributing to existing ones. 

This post will serve as a "table of contents" for that series. I will edit it as necessary.
