title: Switching from Jekyll to Metalsmith
---

Over the last couple of days, I have completely rewritten the source for this blog. 

Jekyll has been good to me for the last three months. However, I found myself wanting more control. I also wanted to be able to write extensions in JavaScript rather than Ruby. 

This blog is now completely built by [Metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith). It's a very simple static site generator written in JavaScript. It's really just a way to help manipulate directories of files, all the interesting stuff is done by plugins. 


I wanted to publish a post today to stick to my schedule. Honestly, I've been working on rewriting my blog generation scripts so much that I don't have time to write a blog post on how it works. 

I'm planning to write a multi-part series on the conversion. I will then move on to customising my blog further and writing my own Metalsmith plugins. 

This post will serve as a "table of contents" for that series. I will edit it as necessary.
