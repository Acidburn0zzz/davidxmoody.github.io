After reading the Influence summary, I decided to jump straight into the recommended follow-on book: [You Can Negotiate Anything](https://app.blinkist.com/blinks/you-can-negotiate-anything-en) by Herb Cohen.

## Most things in the world can be negotiated

Including many things that you don't normally associate with negotiation. 

Often it's just a matter of talking to the right person within an organisation. Sometimes, a person with little power doesn't have the ability to help you even if they wanted to.

The only things that should affect your decision about whether to negotiate for something are:

- Whether you are comfortable doing it
- Whether negotiation will result in your needs being met
- Whether it is worth the effort

## Avoid Soviet-style negotiators

Soviet-style negotiators are characterised by:

- Taking *ridiculous* initial positions and refusing to make *significant concessions*
- Deliberately putting you in contact with negotiators with little authority
- Using unfair emotional tactics (bullying, walking out, crying, etc)

If facing one, set limits ahead of time and be careful to stick to them.

## Win-win negotiations

In contrast, a win-lose mindset is where you take the view that there is a limited amount of resources and you are dividing them up. Aka a zero-sum game. Occasionally, this may be the case but a true *win-win negotiation* is often possible. 

It can be a *mistake* to focus too much on the *demands* of other people. Instead, you should focus on **understanding their underlying needs and unexpressed desires**. 

Different people always have unique differing needs. Multiple people can usually be satisfied without anyone losing out.

It reminds me of listening to product feedback. Often users will demand that you add this feature or that. However the best strategy is usually to try to understand what their unexpressed needs are that the product is not meeting. Focusing too much on feature requests can lead to massive feature bloat without fixing any of the real problems. 

**Trust** can help people be more willing to share their needs and make concessions to others. Highlighting shared goals before the negotiation can also help.
