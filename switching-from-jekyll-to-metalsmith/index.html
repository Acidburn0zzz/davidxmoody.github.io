        <p>Over the last couple of days, I have completely rewritten the source for
          this blog. Jekyll has been good to me for the last three months. However,
          I found myself wanting more control. I also wanted to be able to write
          extensions in JavaScript rather than Ruby. </p>
        <p>This blog is now completely built by <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith">Metalsmith</a>.
          It&#39;s a very simple static site generator. It&#39;s really just a way
          to help manipulate directories of files. All the interesting stuff is
          done by plugins, of which there are plenty.</p>
        <!--more-->

        <p>I wanted to publish this post today to stick to my schedule. However, I&#39;ve
          been working so much on the transition to Metalsmith that I don&#39;t
          have time to write about it today. </p>
        <p>I&#39;m planning to write a multi-part series on the transition. I will
          then write about customising my blog further. I may even get on to publishing
          my own Metalsmith plugins or contributing to existing ones. </p>
        <p>This post will serve as a &quot;table of contents&quot; for that series.
          I will edit it as necessary. </p>
