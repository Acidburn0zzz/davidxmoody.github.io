        <p><strong>I want to become a better writer.</strong> According to the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>,
          I know that this is achievable through <em>hard work and practice</em>.
          I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get
          better. </p>
        <p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for
          publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em>          But, it also has a few problems. Although I&#39;ve never missed a post,
          I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular,
          my writing has suffered because of it.</p>

        <h2 id="how-to-beat-procrastination">How to beat procrastination</h2>
        <p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="/100-push-ups-the-ultimate-slow-gains-experiment/">forming the habit of doing push ups in the morning</a>.
          Although I have only been doing it for 11 days, I&#39;m very pleased with
          how well it has been going. </p>
        <p>I put a reminder on my task list but I haven&#39;t needed it. Every single
          morning without fail, it has been the first thing in my mind after waking
          up. This has been pleasantly surprising. I was expecting to forget occasionally
          but it hasn&#39;t happened so far. </p>
        <p>The key is the <a href="http://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change">habit loop</a>.
          There are three parts to the habit loop: The <strong>Cue</strong>, the
          <strong>Routine</strong> and the <strong>Reward</strong>. The <strong>Cue</strong>          is the thing that triggers the habit. The <strong>Routine</strong> is
          the habit itself. The <strong>Reward</strong> is the benefit you get from
          doing it. </p>
        <p>Although I hadn&#39;t exactly planned it, my recent push ups habit has all
          three of these essential elements.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cue:</strong> Putting my feet on the ground after getting out
            of bed</li>
          <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Doing some push ups</li>
          <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Logging my progress on my laptop</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="the-habit-of-writing-early">The habit of writing early</h2>
        <p>When reading through my diary, I always seem to notice the same trend: Starting
          work early leads to a much more satisfying day. Usually, once I start,
          I find it easy to keep going. You don&#39;t get much more &quot;early&quot;
          than before breakfast so I have decided to adopt the following new habit.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cue:</strong> Logging my push ups habit</li>
          <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Getting out my notebook and working for at least
            one full Pomodoro session (25 minutes)</li>
          <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Log progress on blog, go eat breakfast</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope that starting as early as possible will help prevent procrastination
          later on in the day. Of course, there are a million things I could do
          differently. It might turn out to be a completely inappropriate idea.
          However, that&#39;s the beauty of self-experimentation. Even if it fails
          badly, at least I will have learned something. </p>
        <h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
        <p>Just like with my push ups post, I am going to log my progress right here.
          The following table shows the number of Pomodoro sessions completed <em>before breakfast</em>          on each day.</p>

        <h2 id="update-on-2014-11-10">Update on 2014-11-10</h2>
        <p>After just over one month of continuing this habit, I have decided to stop.
          I&#39;m glad I tried it out. It had many positive points. I feel it helped
          me to write better posts in the time I was doing it. However, I simply
          feel that it doesn&#39;t quite fit with my current goals. I want to try
          experimenting with different ways to spend my time in the morning. I&#39;ll
          write about them soon. </p>
