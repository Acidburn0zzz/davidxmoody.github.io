        <p>For the last three years, I have been working on a little pet project. It
          has probably taught me more about software development than my entire
          time at university. </p>
        <p>It&#39;s a command line program for writing and organising a personal diary
          (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary">GitHub link</a>). I&#39;ve
          spent hundreds of hours on it and have gone through many different designs.
          Instead of covering every little detail of the project, I&#39;m going
          to write about some important lessons it has taught me. </p>

          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve now been blogging for about two months. In that time, I&#39;ve
          written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, <a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">I reviewed my progress</a>          and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it&#39;s time to do it again.

          <p><em>Oct 9, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p><strong>I want to become a better writer.</strong> According to the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>,
          I know that this is achievable through <em>hard work and practice</em>.
          I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get
          better. </p>
        <p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for
          publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em>          But, it also has a few problems. Although I&#39;ve never missed a post,
          I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular,
          my writing has suffered because of it.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t have time to write a proper post right now so here is a big
          list of some of my favourite blogs. I use <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>          as my RSS reader and save longer articles to <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>          for later reading. </p>

          <h1>Writing speeds</h1>
          <p><em>Oct 2, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I like to write a lot. I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For
          something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had.
          Of course, writing fast is only a very small part of being a good writer.
          Nevertheless, these small gains add up. The less time I spend writing,
          the more time I can spend thinking.</p>

          <h1>100 push ups: the ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 29, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>.
          When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities
          can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
        <p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going
          to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise
          habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time
          I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>
