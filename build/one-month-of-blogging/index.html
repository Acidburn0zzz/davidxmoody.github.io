        <p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#39;s
          about 7,000 words. </p>
        <p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely
          ready but I also knew it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I&#39;ve been blogging
          for one month, it&#39;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what
          went well and what could have gone better. </p>
        <h2 id="sticking-to-a-schedule">Sticking to a schedule</h2>
        <p>I set myself the schedule of publishing three posts per week. I&#39;m glad
          I did that. I didn&#39;t want my blog to end up like most programmer&#39;s
          blogs, with only a handful of posts from over a year ago. </p>
        <p>However, after writing my first post, I decided to delay it by about a week.
          I used that time to write three more full posts. By giving myself a buffer,
          I made things easy for myself and increased my confidence that I could
          stick to my schedule. </p>
        <p>Things were easy in the beginning. As time passed, I became lazy. I relied
          on that buffer too much and watched it slowly diminish. By my third week,
          the buffer was gone. I ended up writing most of my eighth post on the
          same day that I published it.</p>
        <p>The quality definitely suffered. It really helps to be able to leave your
          work for a day or two and revisit it with fresh eyes. </p>
        <p>I would also like to be able to offer a more experience-based opinion on
          certain topics. For example, instead of writing &quot;this new Vim plugin
          I found looks like it might be pretty good&quot;, I would like to write
          &quot;this Vim plugin that I&#39;ve been using for the last week is really
          good and here is why&quot;.</p>
        <p>For my own benefit, here is a list of every post on this blog, with the
          number of days between the date it was finished and the date it was published.
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/hello-world/">Hello world</a> (10 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/creating-a-style-for-this-blog/">Creating a style for this blog</a>            (4 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/paragraph-counts-in-jekyll/">Paragraph counts in jekyll</a>            (6 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/wordsearch-game/">Wordsearch game</a> (13 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/namecheap-github-pages-and-apex-domains/">Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains</a>            (2 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/a-third-attempt-at-anki/">A third attempt at Anki</a> (4 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/my-password-generation-scheme/">My password generation scheme</a>            (13 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">Better Vim abbreviations</a> (0 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/vim-auto-capitalisation/">Vim auto-capitalisation</a> (1 day)</li>
          <li><a href="/music-for-programming/">Music for programming</a> (0 days)</li>
          <li><a href="/permanent-bash-aliases/">Permanent Bash aliases</a> (1 day)</li>
          <li><a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">One month of blogging</a> (2 days)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I really wish I&#39;d given myself another couple of days for some of the
          later ones. Looking back at the Vim posts, there are a lot of small things
          I would change. </p>
        <p>One specific thing I have noticed is that I tend to talk about myself too
          much. In the first two paragraphs of the <a href="/vim-auto-capitalisation/">Vim auto-capitalisation</a>          post, I used the pronoun &quot;I&quot; four times when none of them were
          necessary. </p>
        <p>It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/uh/trying_to_try/">this LessWrong post on Trying to Try</a>.
          This is my blog, it should be taken as granted that anything written here
          is my opinion. If I write &quot;Vim is awesome&quot; then that should
          be interpreted as my opinion of Vim. It&#39;s completely unnecessary to
          write &quot;I think Vim is awesome&quot;. It adds more words and makes
          it feel like I&#39;m not certain of my own opinion. I want to get myself
          to write &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot; less on this blog.
          </p>
        <p>Despite my problems, I&#39;m still proud that I actually stuck to my schedule.
          I&#39;m also very happy with the content of my posts, it feels like the
          kind of thing that I would enjoy reading. </p>
        <h2 id="a-better-schedule">A better schedule</h2>
        <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while. Most of my problems come
          from being too rushed. </p>
        <p>When I only have one or two days to write a post, I feel like I can&#39;t
          attempt more ambitious projects. I have lots of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.github.io/blob/master/_ideas.md">ideas</a>          for posts. However, I know that many of them will require a lot of research.
          I don&#39;t want to attempt something difficult if I don&#39;t think I
          can finish on time. </p>
        <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about ways to fix this. I&#39;m going to reduce the
          number of posts to <em>two per week</em>. On <strong>Mondays</strong>          and <strong>Thursdays</strong>. I think this will give me more time to
          research and polish each post. </p>
        <p>I will try it out for about a month and see how it goes. </p>
        <h2 id="a-short-break">A short break</h2>
        <p>However, I&#39;m not going to start straight away. There will be no posts
          for the next week and a bit because I am going on a family holiday. </p>
        <p>I thought about pre-writing several posts and finding the time to publish
          them while I was away. I think that would be a bad idea. It would reduce
          the quality of my writing and make me even more rushed. My next post will
          be on Thursday 18 September 2014. </p>
        <h2 id="publicity">Publicity</h2>
        <p><em>Nobody is reading this blog.</em> That&#39;s fine. I knew right from
          the start that I just wanted to write. I didn&#39;t see the point in trying
          to get people to read a blog which had nothing on it yet. </p>
        <p>Now that I&#39;ve actually written some stuff, I think it&#39;s time to
          start drawing some attention to this blog. I&#39;m not sure how best to
          do that. I will probably create a few social media accounts and start
          tweeting about my posts. I may also start posting a few comments on other
          blogs which address highly-similar topics. </p>
        <p>I want to create a mailing list and add comments to this blog (probably
          with <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>). Also tags for better navigation.
          </p>
        <p>While I&#39;m at it, I also want to add Google Analytics to gather some
          information on how many people are reading this blog. </p>
        <p>I also intend to keep writing. I need the practice. I believe that&#39;s
          the only way this blog will ever truly become &quot;popular&quot;. </p>
