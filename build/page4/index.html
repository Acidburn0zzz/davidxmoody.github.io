          <h1>100 push ups: the ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 29, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>.
          When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities
          can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
        <p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going
          to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise
          habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time
          I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>

        <p>Continued from <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">part 1</a>.
          This part will discuss how the different mindsets affected me after I
          left university.</p>

        </header>

        <p>I am now a firm believer in the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When someone
          has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence,
          talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice.
          This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are
          &quot;fixed&quot; and cannot be improved upon. </p>
        <p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I&#39;m trying to change
          that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the
          different mindsets have impacted me. </p>

          <h1>The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I&#x27;d known</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 18, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the
          Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but
          felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
        <p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My
          opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised
          this sooner. </p>

          <p><em>Sep 5, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#39;s
          about 7,000 words. </p>
        <p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely
          ready but I also knew it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I&#39;ve been blogging
          for one month, it&#39;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what
          went well and what could have gone better. </p>

          </p>
        </header>

        <p>This post will introduce a handy little Bash tip. I created it over a year
          ago but many other people have already done similar things.</p>
        <p>Bash aliases are incredibly convenient. If, for some reason, you don&#39;t
          already use them then you should <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions">read this tutorial</a>.
