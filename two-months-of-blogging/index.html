        <p>I&#39;ve now been blogging for about two months. In that time, I&#39;ve
          written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, <a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">I reviewed my progress</a>          and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it&#39;s time to do it again.

        <h2 id="a-shift-in-topics">A shift in topics</h2>
        <p>There has been a big change in what I&#39;ve been writing about this month.
          Most of my posts have been about <em>non-programming stuff</em>. I&#39;m
          very happy to write about <em>some</em> personal stuff. However, I still
          want to write about programming. After all, the tag-line for this blog
          is supposed to be &quot;A blog about programming&quot;. </p>
        <p>In the future, I want a <em>better spread</em> of topics. I fear that by
          writing too much about personal topics, I risk <em>not being interesting</em>          to readers. </p>
        <h2 id="a-shift-in-writing-habits">A shift in writing habits</h2>
        <p>In my second month, I changed from three posts per week to two per week.
          I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. I ended up spending more time
          on each post. I think the quality of my writing has generally gone up
          because of that. </p>
        <p>It&#39;s a complex trade off between writing more posts and spending longer
          on each post. According to <a href="http://jamesclear.com/equal-odds">the equal odds rule</a>,
          each of my posts has an equal chance of having high impact. That means
          I should focus on creating more of them rather than spending longer on
          each one. However, two posts per week is still quite a lot and if I start
          rushing them too much, the quality will definitely suffer.</p>
        <h2 id="what-i-ve-been-doing-when-i-haven-t-been-blogging">What I&#39;ve been doing when I haven&#39;t been blogging</h2>
        <p>I&#39;ve written a lot about myself this month. However, I have said nothing
          about what I&#39;ve been doing when I haven&#39;t been blogging. </p>
        <p>I&#39;m still living at home with my parents. In the year before I started
          this blog, I was working on the <a href="http://www.professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>          website. </p>
        <p>About two weeks after I started blogging, we found out that my Dad (author
          of the <a href="http://www.professorp.co.uk/books/">Professor P books</a>)
          had to move out of his office. The plan was for him to take over my work
          room in the house and store the Professor P books in the garage. Unfortunately,
          we had a <em>lifetime&#39;s</em> worth of possessions around the house
          which needed to be sorted. I&#39;ve spent much of the last six weeks sorting
          through and selling everything we didn&#39;t need. Stuff like furniture,
          books, toys and everything that my family has bought over the last 25+
          years.</p>
        <p>Oh, and we also won two croquet league finals. I haven&#39;t written about
          croquet yet but I definitely plan to. Here are links to newspaper articles
          for the <a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-win-South-West-Federation/story-23026871-detail/story.html">Association Croquet South West Federation final</a>          and the <a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-triumph-South-West-Handicap/story-23184624-detail/story.html">Golf Croquet Handicap League final</a>.
          Naturally, croquet matches and practice have taken up a lot of my time
          lately. </p>
        <h2 id="my-goals-for-the-future">My goals for the future</h2>
        <p>Anyway, we have nearly finished sorting out the house and the croquet season
          has ended. That&#39;s going to leave me with a lot more free time. I&#39;ve
          been thinking about it and there is only one thing I should be working
          on: <strong>getting a job</strong>. </p>
        <p>I&#39;ve been procrastinating for three years. Admittedly, I have done some
          incredibly valuable stuff in that time but still. </p>
        <p>The power of public commitment is very strong. It&#39;s helped me stick
          to my blogging schedule, even when it&#39;s been hard. I now want to start
          writing about the process of getting a job. </p>
        <h2 id="a-new-schedule">A new schedule</h2>
        <p>Two posts per week has been fine but I&#39;m going to try something different.
          I want to bring this blog back to the topic of programming. I also want
          to start writing about jobs and I also want to continue writing about
          personal things. </p>
        <p>Starting <em>Wednesday 15 October 2014</em>, my new schedule will be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mondays:</strong> A post about my <em>job search</em>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> A post about <em>programming</em>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Fridays:</strong> A post about <em>whatever I like</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
