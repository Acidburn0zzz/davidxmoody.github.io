<h1>100 push ups: The ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
<p><em>Sep 29, 2014</em></p>

<div>
<p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>. When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
<p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
<p>There are lots of exercise plans out there. Far too many in fact. I once tried the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">one hundred push ups training program</a> but never stuck to it. I could write a whole article about why new habits fail. I&#39;ll save that for later. Right now, I want to form the habit of doing push ups. I want it to be <em>simple</em>, <em>easy</em> and <em>repeatable daily</em>. </p>
<p>My plan is to do <em>exactly two push ups</em> every single morning this week. Next week, I will do <em>exactly four push ups</em> every single morning. The week after, <em>exactly six push ups</em> every single morning. </p>
<p>And so on. In just under a year, I will be doing 100 push ups a day (hence the title). </p>
<h2 id="so-easy-i-can-t-fail">So easy I can&#39;t fail</h2>
<p>I can currently do <em>seven</em> good-form push ups. In some ways, doing just two per day in the first week feels <em>too easy</em>. I already know that it&#39;s not going to be challenging. However, that&#39;s the point. <em>It&#39;s supposed to be easy</em>. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if my plan will eventually become too hard. I might have to add rest days or short rests between sets of push ups. I&#39;ll just have to see how it goes. </p>
<p><a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> has written a lot about <a href="http://jamesclear.com/slow-gains">how slow gains add up quickly</a>. I want this new habit to stick. I trying to do that by keeping it easy and simple and doing it every single day. </p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>I&#39;m also writing about it on this blog for public accountability. In fact, rather than just writing this post and forgetting about it, I&#39;m going to go one step further. I&#39;m going to keep a log of the exact number of push ups I do every day and place it right here. </p>

<p><em>[Edit: I stuck to this habit for eight weeks before missing my first day which I&#39;m pretty pleased with. I then continued for another ten days before I got ill for a week. After that it seemed much harder to complete each day. I also think I didn&#39;t include enough rest time. Some days, my muscles were just too sore before I even did my first push up. Overall it was a great experiment and I&#39;m proud I managed to stick to it for so long. Next time, I try something like this, I think I should do something to plan for sick days and rest days.]</em></p>
