<h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
<p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>
<!--more-->
<p>I created several other abbreviations for common typing patterns (mostly avoiding having to type apostrophes and capital letters). Here is a small sample:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim">iab i I
iab iv I&#39;ve
iab il I&#39;ll
iab dont don&#39;t
iab monday Monday
iab february February
iab cof CoffeeScript
</code></pre>
<p>I keep these English-only abbreviations in a separate file (<code>~/.vim/abbreviations.vim</code>) which gets sourced when editing Markdown or text files. </p>
<p>Some people also like to add common typos to their list of abbreviations. I have a few of those but I like to keep them to a minimum. When possible, I prefer to force myself to re-type the word correctly so that I learn the proper spelling. </p>
<h2 id="annoyances">Annoyances</h2>
<p>This worked well for me for a long time but it had two problems that kept bugging me. One was that I had to manually add the capitalized versions of all my abbreviations. For example, <code>iab cant can&#39;t</code> as well as <code>iab Cant Can&#39;t</code>. This duplication of information was annoying and felt messy. </p>
<p>The other problem was that it was a pain to add new abbreviations. I had to manually open up my abbreviations file every time. </p>
<p>I was about to start creating my own script to deal with this stuff. Thankfully, one already exists. </p>
<h2 id="abolish-plugin">Abolish plugin</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">Vim Abolish plugin</a> is pretty neat. Read the tutorial for a full walkthrough of the features. It lets you do stuff like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim"><span class="hljs-comment">" Typing the following:</span>
Abolish seperate separate

<span class="hljs-comment">" Is equivalent to:</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">iabbrev</span> seperate separate
<span class="hljs-keyword">iabbrev</span> Seperate Separate
<span class="hljs-keyword">iabbrev</span> SEPERATE SEPARATE
</code></pre>
<p>It has more advanced features which allow you to group together related words:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim">Abolish <span class="hljs-keyword">cal</span>{<span class="hljs-keyword">a</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>}nder{,s} <span class="hljs-keyword">cal</span>{<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>}ndar{}
</code></pre>
<p>Also, if you place a <code>!</code> at the end, you can add words to you abbreviations file easily:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim"><span class="hljs-comment">" In ~/.vim/abbreviations.vim (or where-ever you like)</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">" `expand('&lt;sfile&gt;:p')` gets the absolute path of the </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">" current file that this is being executed from</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> <span class="hljs-variable">g:abolish_save_file</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">expand</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;sfile&gt;:p'</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> !exists(<span class="hljs-string">":Abolish"</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">finish</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">endif</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">" Typing `:Abolish! im I'm` will append the following</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">" to the end of this file:</span>
Abolish <span class="hljs-keyword">im</span> I<span class="hljs-string">'m</span>
</code></pre>
<p>There is also a <code>Subvert</code> command for doing similar things in search and replace:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim"><span class="hljs-string">" Will replace "</span>Facilities<span class="hljs-string">" with "</span>Buildings<span class="hljs-comment">", etc.</span>
:%Subvert/facilit{<span class="hljs-keyword">y</span>,ies}/building{,s}/g
</code></pre>
<p>Again, check the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">GitHub repo</a> for more details. I haven&#39;t been using the plugin for long but I really like it so far. </p>
