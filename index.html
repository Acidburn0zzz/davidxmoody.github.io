          <h1>Word frequency analysis with command line tools</h1>
          <p><em>Feb 20, 2015</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>I have previously written about <a href="/writing-speeds/">writing speeds</a>.
          I think one of the best ways to improve is to utilise <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">abbreviations</a>          and other <a href="/vim-auto-capitalisation/">tricks</a>. </p>
        <p>I recently looked into a shorthand system called <a href="http://www.easyscript.com/">EasyScript</a>.
          The most important part I took from it is to develop a set of short abbreviations
          for the most common words. They give a set of suggested abbreviations
          but I wasn&#39;t happy with them. Instead, I wanted to analyse my own
          writing to find my most commonly used words and phrases. </p>

          <h1>Building a blog with Metalsmith</h1>
          <p><em>Feb 11, 2015</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>I recently transitioned this blog from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>          to <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>. I&#39;m glad I
          started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to
          Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I
          knew (JavaScript). </p>
        <p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See
          <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a>          for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before
          (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website).
          I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal
          restrictions. </p>
        <p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming
          that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty.
          Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve
          come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

          <h1>CloudFlare and hashed CSS</h1>
          <p><em>Feb 2, 2015</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>One of the main advantages of static sites is supposed to be faster load
          times. However, I noticed this blog was still taking longer than expected
          to load. </p>
        <p>I discovered <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2014/04/transferring-the-dns-from-namecheap-to-cloudflare-for-github-pages/">this post by David Ensinger</a>          in which he describes the same problem. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his
          other posts and we appear to have pretty similar setups. The problem he
          describes is a time consuming 302 redirect caused by using GitHub Pages
          with a DNS <code>A</code> record. I suggest you look at his post for more
          details. </p>

          <h1>Host any static site with GitHub Pages</h1>
          <p><em>Jan 26, 2015</em></p>
        </header>

        <p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is pretty awesome.
          It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
          However, it also has some limitations.</p>
        <p>For example, although Jekyll &quot;supports&quot; tags, you can&#39;t create
          pages to list all posts with a given tag. At least not without using a
          plugin, which GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t allow.</p>
        <p>There is an easy way around this. You can build the site locally (using
          any plugins or code you want) and still host it on GitHub Pages. It&#39;s
          pretty simple although there are a few caveats. </p>

        <p>This will be my third monthly review. Yet again, I am going to look back
          at the last month and create a plan for the next one. </p>

          <h1>20 of my favourite cooking photos</h1>
          <p><em>Nov 7, 2014</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>I started learning to cook in September 2011. I really enjoyed it. I learned
          from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>
        <p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then,
          I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting
          recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus
          One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty
          worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>
