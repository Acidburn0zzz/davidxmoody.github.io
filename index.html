          <h1>Switching from Jekyll to Metalsmith</h1>
          <p><em>Nov 17, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Over the last couple of days, I have completely rewritten the source for
          this blog. Jekyll has been good to me for the last three months. However,
          I found myself wanting more control. I also wanted to be able to write
          extensions in JavaScript rather than Ruby. </p>
        <p>This blog is now completely built by <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith">Metalsmith</a>.
          It&#39;s a very simple static site generator. It&#39;s really just a way
          to help manipulate directories of files. All the interesting stuff is
          done by plugins, of which there are plenty.</p>

          <h1>20 of my favourite cooking photos</h1>
          <p><em>Nov 7, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I started learning to cook in September 2011. I really enjoyed it. I learned
          from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>
        <p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then,
          I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting
          recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus
          One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty
          worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>

          <h1>My 10 best Tenerife photos</h1>
          <p><em>Oct 31, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>In March of this year, I went on a family holiday with my parents to Tenerife.
          It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. </p>
        <p>That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just
          bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had
          to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I&#39;ve
          probably got about 50 very good ones but that&#39;s too many for one blog
          post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.</p>
