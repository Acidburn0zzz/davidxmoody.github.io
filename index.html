      <div><article><header><h1>Blinkist book review: A Guide to the Good Life</h1><p><em>Jun 19, 2016</em></p></header><div><p>This is my review of <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/a-guide-to-the-good-life-en.html">A Guide to the Good Life</a> by William B. Irvine. It&#39;s a book about Stoicism.</p>
<p>The previous three book summaries I read were packed full of specific tips. The next few are all a bit shorter and deal with more abstract concepts rather than actionable bullet points. </p>

Cialdini. </p>
<p>I bought this book on Kindle about 4 years ago but only read the fist three chapters. I&#39;ve always wanted to finish it and this was a good opportunity to see what else was in the book.</p>

Lencioni. </p>
<p>I first heard about this book from <a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/04/you-can-bring-horse-to-water.html">this blog post</a> on the Elided Branches blog (which is absolutely excellent by the way). I expect to read it in full someday but thought I may as well start with a summary. </p>

They provide 15 minute summaries of non-fiction books. My initial experience has been amazing and I have now subscribed to them.</p>
<p>I have also been writing notes on paper of all the summaries I&#39;ve been reading. The first book I read was <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/the-miracle-morning-en.html">The Miracle Morning</a> by Hal Elrod.</p>

I didn&#39;t get around to publishing it at the time but decided I&#39;d rather publish it now than delete it.]</em></p>
<p>These are some of my notes from reading through the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer documentation</a>. I was using version 1.2.3 so things may have changed since then.</p>

It is not finished to the standard that I originally planned but I decided I&#39;d still rather publish it now than delete it.]</em></p>
<p>I first started programming JavaScript with vanilla ES5. I disliked it right from the start having grown accustomed to the nice syntax of Python and ended up switching to CoffeeScript for quite a while. However, around June of last year, I got interested in ES6/ES2015 again.</p>
<p>These are some of my notes from reading <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/">this book</a> on ES6 features. I deliberately didn&#39;t write about anything I already found trivial, deciding to only focus on things I didn&#39;t already know. I never got to the end of the book but still decided to publish it.</p>

In this post, I will describe my particular implementation with <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/experiments">Google Analytics Content Experiments</a> and what I learned along the way.</p>

For both work and side projects. </p>
<p>Although I have released everything I&#39;ve ever made on <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a>, I had never created anything which other people could <em>actually use</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to change that. This is the story of how I published my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-broken-link-checker">first npm package</a> and what I learned along the way.</p>
