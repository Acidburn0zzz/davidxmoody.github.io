<h1>Selling my childhood toys on eBay and Amazon</h1>
<p><em>Oct 17, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p>I mentioned in my <a href="/two-months-of-blogging/#what-ive-been-doing-when-i-havent-been-blogging">two months of blogging post</a> that I&#39;ve been selling my family&#39;s old possessions on eBay and Amazon. Over the last couple of years, I have sold literally 144 things on eBay and 153 things on Amazon. I thought I&#39;d share a few of my thoughts on how it&#39;s gone.</p>

<h1>Lessons learned from a three year programming project (part 1)</h1>
<p><em>Oct 15, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p>For the last three years, I have been working on a little pet project. It has probably taught me more about software development than my entire time at university. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a command line program for writing and organising a personal diary (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary">GitHub link</a>). I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours on it and have gone through many different designs. Instead of covering every little detail of the project, I&#39;m going to write about some important lessons it has taught me. </p>

<h1>Two months of blogging</h1>
<p><em>Oct 13, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p>I&#39;ve now been blogging for about two months. In that time, I&#39;ve written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, <a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">I reviewed my progress</a> and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it&#39;s time to do it again. </p>

<h1>Writing before breakfast</h1>
<p><em>Oct 9, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p><strong>I want to become a better writer.</strong> According to the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>, I know that this is achievable through <em>hard work and practice</em>. I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get better. </p>
<p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em> But, it also has a few problems. Although I&#39;ve never missed a post, I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular, my writing has suffered because of it.</p>
