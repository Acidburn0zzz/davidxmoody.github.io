<p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold &#39;em poker-bot</strong> which uses the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.</p>

Over the last couple of years, I have sold literally 144 things on eBay and 153 things on Amazon. I thought I&#39;d share a few of my thoughts on how it&#39;s gone.</p>

It has probably taught me more about software development than my entire time at university. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a command line program for writing and organising a personal diary (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary">GitHub link</a>). I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours on it and have gone through many different designs. Instead of covering every little detail of the project, I&#39;m going to write about some important lessons it has taught me. </p>

In that time, I&#39;ve written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, <a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">I reviewed my progress</a> and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it&#39;s time to do it again. </p>

I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get better. </p>
<p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em> But, it also has a few problems. Although I&#39;ve never missed a post, I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular, my writing has suffered because of it.</p>
