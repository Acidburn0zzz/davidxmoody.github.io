<h1>Two months of blogging</h1>
<p><em>Oct 13, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve now been blogging for about two months. In that time, I&#39;ve written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, <a href="/one-month-of-blogging/">I reviewed my progress</a> and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it&#39;s time to do it again. </p>

<h1>Writing before breakfast</h1>
<p><em>Oct 9, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p><strong>I want to become a better writer.</strong> According to the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>, I know that this is achievable through <em>hard work and practice</em>. I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get better. </p>
<p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em> But, it also has a few problems. Although I&#39;ve never missed a post, I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular, my writing has suffered because of it.</p>

<h1>Writing speeds</h1>
<p><em>Oct 2, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I like to write a lot. I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had. Of course, writing fast is only a very small part of being a good writer. Nevertheless, these small gains add up. The less time I spend writing, the more time I can spend thinking.</p>

<h1>100 push ups: The ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
<p><em>Sep 29, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>. When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
<p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>

<h1>The growth mindset applied to my life (part 1)</h1>
<p><em>Sep 22, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I am now a firm believer in the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When someone has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence, talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice. This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are &quot;fixed&quot; and cannot be improved upon. </p>
<p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I&#39;m trying to change that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the different mindsets have impacted me. </p>

<h1>The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I&#x27;d known</h1>
<p><em>Sep 18, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
<p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised this sooner. </p>

<h1>One month of blogging</h1>
<p><em>Sep 5, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#39;s about 7,000 words. </p>
<p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely ready but I also knew it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I&#39;ve been blogging for one month, it&#39;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better. </p>
