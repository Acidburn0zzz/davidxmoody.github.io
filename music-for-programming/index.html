        <p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces
          the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the
          right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>
        <!--more-->

        <h2 id="grooveshark-broadcasts">Grooveshark broadcasts</h2>
        <p><a href="http://grooveshark.com/">Grooveshark</a> is pretty great. It offers
          an incredibly easy to use streaming service. It runs in the browser and
          is completely free. </p>
        <p>I like the <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/broadcasts">broadcasts</a>          section. It&#39;s essentially user-created radio stations. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/writhem/broadcast">Programming Electronic &amp; Alternative</a>          is my favourite. Any other EDM broadcast without vocals is usually pretty
          good too. </p>
        <p>I also think it&#39;s worth creating a Grooveshark account so that you can
          save your favourite tracks. Stopping work to read about the current track
          is very distracting. Switching tabs and clicking the favourite button
          is easier.</p>
        <h2 id="musicforprogramming-">musicForProgramming();</h2>
        <p><a href="http://musicforprogramming.net/">musicForProgramming();</a> is
          another source of free music meant to aid concentration. I like it. There
          is a lot of interesting music on there. </p>
        <p>My only criticism is that there is a bit too much silence mixed in with
          the tracks. I find that when there is too much silence, background noises
          suddenly become distracting again. It&#39;s still worth checking out though,
          especially if you are already working in a quiet environment. </p>
        <h2 id="get-work-done-music">Get Work Done Music</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.getworkdonemusic.com/">Get Work Done Music</a> is another
          free and very simple streaming service. It has just two options: &quot;Fast&quot;
          and &quot;Faster&quot;. It serves up music from Soundcloud which is suitable
          for working. I love the simplicity and also the music.</p>
        <h2 id="assassin-s-creed-2-ost">Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 OST</h2>
        <p><a href="http://ryanio.com/2014/music-to-get-work-done/">Here&#39;s another article about music for programming</a>          which inspired this article. One of my (now favourite) albums was taken
          straight from it. It&#39;s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH1wfrOcvHg">Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 soundtrack</a>.
          </p>
        <p>I think I&#39;ve literally listened to it over 50 times now. Hearing it
          again instantly brings up memories of working on the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>          website. I find it has <em>exactly</em> the right balance of enough sound
          to drown out background noise, sounding great and not being <em>too</em>          distracting. </p>
        <h2 id="shatter-ost">Shatter OST</h2>
        <p>Another of my absolute favourite video game soundtracks is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxP7VBbhRaw">Shatter</a>.
          I originally got it from one of the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundles</a>.
          It&#39;s now one of my favourite albums of all time. </p>
        <p>The only bad thing I can say about it is that it&#39;s just <strong>too damn good</strong>.
          I sometimes find myself getting distracted from my work because I just
          can&#39;t stop nodding my head.</p>
        <h2 id="overclocked-remix">OverClocked ReMix</h2>
        <p>Yet another fantastic source of free music is <a href="http://ocremix.org/">OverClocked ReMix</a>.
          It has tons of great video game soundtrack remixes. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you can&#39;t actually stream from them which makes discovering
          new music quite hard. Every now and then, I download a new album at random.
          Some are great, some are okay. Two of my favourites are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://ocremix.org/album/54/audio-engineering-a-tribute-to-cid">Audio Engineering: A Tribute to Cid</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://ocremix.org/album/37/mega-man-x-maverick-rising">Mega Man X: Maverick Rising</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="other-tips">Other tips</h2>
        <p>When you are listening to music all day long, you really have to be careful.
          From personal experience, I can tell you that listening to loud music
          all day <em>will absolutely give you a terrible headache</em>. </p>
        <p>The best way to avoid that is to simply listen at a lower volume. Slightly
          lower than &quot;normal&quot; music volume. </p>
        <p>Higher-quality noise isolating headphones can help. By blocking out external
          noise, they allow you to listen at lower volumes while still being able
          to hear the music properly. </p>
        <p>With my laptop and phone, I use <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HP3OB0">these SoundMAGIC E10 Earphones</a>.
          I&#39;ve had them just over three months and they are the best earphones
          I&#39;ve ever used. Both the sound quality and design is excellent. At
          Â£24, they aren&#39;t super cheap but they are still cheap enough that
          I feel okay about carrying them unprotected in my pocket. </p>
        <p>For my standing desk, I use <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ADJG95I">these Bluedio Bluetooth headphones</a>.
          I&#39;ve tried a lot of different headphones over the last few years.
          I&#39;ve found that for a <em>standing desk</em>, absolutely nothing can
          beat the convenience of wireless. The freedom of movement they offer is
          more important than anything else. My pair are falling to pieces a little
          bit. Partly due to a year of hard use and partly due to weak plastic.
          I would buy them again but I&#39;m also interested in looking for alternatives.
          </p>
        <h2 id="music-is-awesome">Music is awesome</h2>
        <p>I can&#39;t understate the importance of music for work. It took me a long
          time to realise that, partly because I had nothing to listen to. All of
          my music had distracting vocals. Now that I&#39;ve found some great music
          to listen to, I couldn&#39;t imagine going back. </p>
