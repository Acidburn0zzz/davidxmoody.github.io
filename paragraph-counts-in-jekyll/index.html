<h1>Paragraph counts in jekyll</h1>
<p><em>Aug 15, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>. There is one thing I particularly like about their RSS feed. It shows the first few paragraphs of the article followed by a link saying &quot;Read X remaining paragraphs&quot;. </p>
<p>If I can&#39;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next best option. It has two big advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to read the whole thing</li>
<li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p>I&#39;ve seen many <em>bad</em> approaches to the same problem. Some feeds contain very limited information, frequently just the first paragraph of the article. I feel that the first paragraph alone is not usually enough to decide if the entire article is worth reading. </p>
<h2 id="emulating-it-in-jekyll">Emulating it in Jekyll</h2>
<p>I wanted something like this for my blog. Both for the summary of all posts on the front page and also for the RSS feed. </p>
<p>Jekyll already contains support for excerpts (accessible with <code>post.excerpt</code>). By default, the excerpt of a post will be the first paragraph. </p>
<p>However, jekyll also supports setting a custom <code>excerpt_separator</code> variable in the <code>_config.yml</code> file. I changed mine to be two empty lines instead of the default of one. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">excerpt_separator</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span>    <span class="c1"># Default</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">excerpt_separator</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;\n\n\n&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># My version</span>
</pre></div>

</code>
</pre>
<p>In each of my posts I then add an extra new line after the point I want the excerpt to end. You could choose anything for the excerpt separator but I like this because it is simple and doesn&#39;t mess with the Markdown processing. </p>
<h2 id="counting-paragraphs">Counting paragraphs</h2>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve defined a custom, multi-paragraph excerpt, we still need to count the number of <em>remaining</em> paragraphs in the post. </p>
<p>Liquid templates weren&#39;t really designed for this kind of stuff and they lack full regular expression support. However, they do have the very convenient <code>split</code> filter which we will be using. We can split the formatted HTML of the post on the <code>&#39;&lt;p&gt;&#39;</code> substring. This will break it into segments for each paragraph. One slight caveat is that there will be an empty string before the first paragraph.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div class="highlight"><pre>{% assign total_paragraphs = post.content | split: &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>&#39; | size | minus: 1 %}
{% assign excerpt_paragraphs = post.excerpt | split: &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>&#39; | size | minus: 1 %}
{% assign remaining_paragraphs = total_paragraphs | minus: excerpt_paragraphs %}
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ post.url }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Read {{ remaining_paragraphs }} remaining paragraphs...<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="short-posts">Short posts</h2>
<p>What if you want to write a short post though? One where you want the excerpt to equal the entire post. Not a problem. If you simply don&#39;t include the <code>excerpt_separator</code> in your post then the excerpt will be equal to the full content of the post. </p>
<p>You could also change the wording a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ post.url }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  {% if remaining_paragraphs &gt; 0 %}
  Read {{ remaining_paragraphs }} remaining paragraphs...
  {% else %}
  View post on separate page
  {% endif %}
<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
