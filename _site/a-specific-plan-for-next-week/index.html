I said that I wanted to focus on <strong>getting a job</strong>.</p><p>I have certainly made some progress. I have written <a href="/cv/">my CV</a> (which I’m very pleased with). I have also written a lot of blog posts which <em>support my CV</em>. By that, I mean I have written about many of the projects mentioned on my CV. I wanted to provide evidence that I’d actually done them and show more examples of my work.</p><p>I’m pleased with what I’ve done but my job search is still going slower than I would like. I feel like I’ve been procrastinating more than usual this last week because I <strong>didn’t have a clear plan</strong>. I had finished writing my CV and didn’t know what to do next. Simply saying “get a job” is far too vague. I need a better plan.</p><h2 id="a-better-plan">A better plan</h2><p>The following steps are what I think are <em>required</em> for me to get a job:</p><ol><li>Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work</li><li>Apply to those places</li><li>Go to interviews</li></ol><p>Additionally, there are a few <em>bonus</em> steps which I think will increase the chances of me getting a better job:</p><ul><li>Continue blogging (about programming topics in particular)</li><li>“Interview practice” (i.e. practise talking about my recent projects in front of a camera)</li><li>Continue travelling to Bristol and start going to meetups</li></ul><h2 id="the-next-step">The next step</h2><p>From the above plan, the clear and unambiguous next step is:</p><ol><li>Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work</li></ol><p>That will be the focus of this week. I am going to do a minimum of one Pomodoro per day on this task. By next week’s post, I want to have a better understanding of what types of jobs are available in my field. I also want to identify 5 specific job openings that I could apply for.</p></article></div><div class="push"></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><p> <br> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davidxmoody">RSS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:david@davidxmoody.com">Email</a></p><p> This blog is available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 License</a></p> </footer><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-54505873-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
