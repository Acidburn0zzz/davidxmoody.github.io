Yet again, I am going to look back at the last month and create a plan for the next one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-better-spread-of-topics"&gt;A better spread of topics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first month of this blog, I wrote mostly about programming topics. For the second month, I switched to writing mostly about personal topics. In &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/two-months-of-blogging/"&gt;my previous monthly review&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed this. I set myself a more specific schedule in order to focus my writing on &lt;em&gt;a better spread of topics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased with every post I’ve written over the last month. I notice that most of them were about the major experiences of my life so far. The reason for that is that I was in the process of writing my CV and realised I had no &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; to support my claims. Most of what I’ve written this month was written to support the main points of &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/cv/"&gt;my CV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="last-week"&gt;Last week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the last month has been excellent for me. However, the last week has been an exception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/a-specific-plan-for-next-week/"&gt;specific plan&lt;/a&gt;. I said I wanted to &lt;em&gt;“Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work”&lt;/em&gt;. I also said I would do one Pomodoro on the task every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it the first two days before realising that it really wasn’t getting me anywhere. I already know the exact type of job I want (web development, matching my existing skills). I also know that there are many such jobs available. What I really need to do is get to the point where I can actually apply for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still a few things to do before then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Convert my CV to PDF for sending with applications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Write a covering letter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make my blog more presentable (currently the good stuff is too hard to find and the home page isn’t very helpful)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really should have just started on the above list but instead I ran into another problem. That problem was &lt;a href="http://bindingofisaac.com/"&gt;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;. It was released Tuesday night and I’ve spent &lt;em&gt;far too much time&lt;/em&gt; playing it over the last week. I managed to stick to my blogging schedule but I didn’t get much else done. I definitely regret spending so much time on it. I’m pleased to say that I feel like I’m over it now. I might play it occasionally but I’m not going to obsess over it like I have this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="focus-for-next-month"&gt;Focus for next month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, I mostly focused on writing about my past experiences. However, I’ve now written about most of them. I have a few more left but not enough to continue for another month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious focus for this month is the same as for last month: &lt;strong&gt;getting a job&lt;/strong&gt;. I certainly made some progress last month with writing my CV and writing about my previous projects. I still could have done more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I still don’t feel that writing about getting a job is really going to be that interesting. What I actually want to write about is &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt;. I want to continue learning about web development and then blog about what I learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next month, my main focus will be on getting a job. However, I will continue to write about programming on this blog as my secondary aim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-new-schedule"&gt;A new schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my first month, I consistently published three posts per week. For my second month, I went down to two and then for my third month I went back up to three. It has been incredibly successful for me so far but I still want to try something new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next month, I am going to publish one post every Monday (about my progress that week). Additionally, I will write about whatever programming projects I’m learning about. However, I won’t schedule those. I’m going to try simply publishing them whenever it is convenient for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes against everything that has worked for me so far. However, I think it could be a good move. It gives me more &lt;em&gt;flexibility&lt;/em&gt; to work on what is most important at the time. Of course, I could be wrong and it could be a terrible idea. However, I’m viewing it as an &lt;strong&gt;experiment&lt;/strong&gt;. After one month, I’ll see how it has gone and decide whether or not I want to continue. &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/three-months-of-blogging/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/three-months-of-blogging/</guid> </item> <item><title>20 of my favourite cooking photos</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;I started learning to cook in September 2011. I really enjoyed it. I learned from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-06-09_12-02-42_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea bass with peppers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-10-01_11-55-36_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jerk chicken on salad with corn on the cob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-09-12_12-02-08_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trout with herbs and orange dressing on spinach with chips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-09-10_12-32-38_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moroccan chicken on purple cauliflower rice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-09-11_13-31-00_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuffed aubergines with sweet potato mash and minty green bean salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-07-23_12-29-35_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicken skewers with satay sauce and noodles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-05-15_12-01-15_dmc-fs30_v1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmon with chilli and coriander butter and mango and avocado salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-07-15_17-38-39_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuffed squash with leek and bean salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-07-24_13-57-07_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish tagine with pollock and a lemon and fennel salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-09-20_12-35-29_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicken tahini salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-09-22_11-58-53_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fishcake with sweet potato chips, peas and lemon caper sauce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-01-19_14-50-26_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicken salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-02-14_14-17-30_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moroccan chicken kebabs with parsley, feta, almond and date salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-04-12_12-25-21_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cauliflower rice bowl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-04-27_12-59-01_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stir fry chicken with a roast tomato dressing and crispy Parmesan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-06-29_12-13-29_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmon with green beans and pine nuts and fried potatoes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-07-22_14-13-36_dmc-lz20.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Griddled courgette and salmon salad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-08-03_13-48-28_nikon-d3100_v1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey meatballs with apricot sauce on courgette pasta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2013-10-29_20-05-34_nikon-d3100_v1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butternut squash stuffed with leeks, served with courgette pasta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/20-of-my-favourite-cooking-photos/2012-10-12_12-29-15_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blueberry, walnut and avocado salad with raspberry dressing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There is only one left: &lt;strong&gt;my dotfiles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/dotfiles"&gt;view them on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to upload them because I think there are a few interesting fragments in there. Someone might find something they need. It also makes it easier for me to clone them from another machine, should the need ever arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are about 200 commits, spanning three years. I don’t pretend to be an expert in these things but I still feel my dotfiles reflect a lot of experience over that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s slightly messy at the moment. I would like to organise them better someday. I recently found &lt;a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/"&gt;GitHub does dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;. It has some very interesting links to other dotfile repositories and frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, I am going to highlight a few of the most interesting things in my dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="mkalias"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkalias&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/permanent-bash-aliases/"&gt;already written a blog post on this function&lt;/a&gt; which you should check out. The gist of it is that it takes too long to open up your &lt;code&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; file just to create a new alias. My simple Bash function works just like the normal &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; command except it makes the alias “permanent” by placing it into your aliases file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;mkalias&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Flatten arguments into one string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;full_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Extract the first and last parts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;alias_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;full_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;%%=*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;alias_result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;full_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;#*=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Construct the new command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;alias_command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;alias $alias_name=&amp;#39;$alias_result&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Execute the command, if successful then print &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# out the alias and add it to ~/.bash_aliases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$alias_command&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$alias_name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; tee -a &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$HOME/.bash_aliases&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="jpeg-metadata-stripping-and-resizing"&gt;JPEG metadata stripping and resizing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you take a photo, a lot of extra data is created. Stuff like the date, camera model, exposure and whatnot. However, when you are creating a website, there is no point downloading all that data along with the image. It can often take up around 20KB of extra space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use this handy &lt;code&gt;stripjpg&lt;/code&gt; alias to strip out all Exif data. I also use &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt; to downscale images to 800px wide (for this blog). It’s not a perfect responsive image setup but it works for now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;stripjpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;exiftool -all= &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; resize800&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; stripjpg &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; f in &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; convert &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; -resize 800x &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="word-frequency-script"&gt;Word frequency script&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little something I created when I wanted to find the number of occurrences of common words in a large corpus of text split across multiple files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python3" data-lang="python3"&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;word_tallies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;word_tallies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;word_tallies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="vim-writing-tricks"&gt;Vim writing tricks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I have already written about &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/vim-auto-capitalisation/"&gt;Vim auto-capitalisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/better-vim-abbreviations/"&gt;better Vim abbreviations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, I still love them both. They both save me several minutes daily. Not having to press the shift key so much also makes my little fingers very happy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="home-setup-script"&gt;&lt;code&gt;home-setup&lt;/code&gt; script&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve gone through some very complex and messy dotfile setups in the last three years. I finally settled upon a very simple script. It simply symlinks everything in &lt;code&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; to my home directory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appends a dot to the names (because I don’t like hidden files in a project directory specifically meant for dotfiles).

I said that I wanted to focus on &lt;strong&gt;getting a job&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have certainly made some progress. I have written &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/cv/"&gt;my CV&lt;/a&gt; (which I’m very pleased with). I have also written a lot of blog posts which &lt;em&gt;support my CV&lt;/em&gt;. By that, I mean I have written about many of the projects mentioned on my CV. I wanted to provide evidence that I’d actually done them and show more examples of my work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased with what I’ve done but my job search is still going slower than I would like. I feel like I’ve been procrastinating more than usual this last week because I &lt;strong&gt;didn’t have a clear plan&lt;/strong&gt;. I had finished writing my CV and didn’t know what to do next. Simply saying “get a job” is far too vague. I need a better plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-better-plan"&gt;A better plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following steps are what I think are &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for me to get a job:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apply to those places&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go to interviews&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are a few &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt; steps which I think will increase the chances of me getting a better job:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continue blogging (about programming topics in particular)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Interview practice” (i.e. practise talking about my recent projects in front of a camera)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continue travelling to Bristol and start going to meetups&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-next-step"&gt;The next step&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above plan, the clear and unambiguous next step is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will be the focus of this week. I am going to do a minimum of one Pomodoro per day on this task. By next week’s post, I want to have a better understanding of what types of jobs are available in my field. I also want to identify 5 specific job openings that I could apply for. &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/a-specific-plan-for-next-week/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/a-specific-plan-for-next-week/</guid> </item> <item><title>My 10 best Tenerife photos</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;In March of this year, I went on a family holiday with my parents to Tenerife. It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I’ve probably got about 50 very good ones but that’s too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="botanical-gardens"&gt;Botanical gardens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-10_13-54-37_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-10_13-55-26_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-10_15-53-09_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-coast"&gt;The coast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-11_16-00-23_x10_v1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-13_17-17-20_x10_v1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="more-gardens"&gt;More gardens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-12_14-45-56_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-12_14-51-42_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="loro-park"&gt;Loro Park&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-14_16-07-04_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-14_17-04-00_x10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="out-of-the-airplane-window"&gt;Out of the airplane window&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/2014-03-15_18-37-51_dmc-fs30.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/my-10-best-tenerife-photos/</guid> </item> <item><title>MCTS in Texas Hold 'em Poker: A retrospective</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently been uploading a lot of my old projects. Both to prove I’ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a &lt;strong&gt;Texas Hold ‘em poker-bot&lt;/strong&gt; which uses the &lt;strong&gt;Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;. You can &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot"&gt;view the source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-build-a-poker-bot"&gt;How to build a poker-bot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My poker-bot runs as a plugin to &lt;a href="http://www.poker-academy.com/poker-software/"&gt;Poker Academy Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial program which can run custom bots written in Java. It also came with a nice little example poker-bot called SimpleBot. I based most of my dissertation around how well my poker-bot (MCTSBot) could play against SimpleBot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/PAP1-800x.png" alt="Screenshot of Poker Academy Pro" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to write a complete description of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm in this post. If you are interested, you can check out chapters 2.4 and 2.5 of &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf"&gt;my dissertation (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, I’ll just say that it uses random simulations to gradually build up a partial game tree. It uses advanced strategies to find a balance between &lt;em&gt;exploring&lt;/em&gt; new branches and &lt;em&gt;exploiting&lt;/em&gt; the most promising branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered that a decent &lt;strong&gt;opponent model&lt;/strong&gt; was vital to the success of the program. An opponent model helps to predict what moves an opponent will make and increases the accuracy of simulations. To create one, I used &lt;a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/"&gt;Weka&lt;/a&gt;, a handy set of open source machine learning algorithms. I would have loved to create my own machine learning algorithms but it would have been well beyond the scope of the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also spent a lot of time creating tools to extract and analyse the data. I even wrote a simple graphical user interface which ran beside Poker Academy Pro. It displayed a &lt;em&gt;live view&lt;/em&gt; of the expected values of each possible move as it was calculating them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/GUI.png" alt="Screenshot of my GUI" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of my dissertation was not only to build a working poker-bot but also to analyse its performance in different situations. Again, I recommend you check out chapter 4 of &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf"&gt;my full dissertation (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; for a proper explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the project, my poker-bot was consistently able to beat SimpleBot. However, it was a tough battle to get there. The following graph shows MCTSBot’s performance with and without the two different opponent models I used (&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ank &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;pponent &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;odel and &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;ext &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ove &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;pponent &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;odel). It shows that both models were required to turn a positive average profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/SBvMB-oppmodels-v2.png" alt="Graph showing the effectiveness of different opponent models" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also explored how other parameters affected performance. Here is a quick graph of MCTSBot’s performance as its thinking time is varied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/SBvMB-time.png" alt="Graph showing the effects of varying thinking time" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this blog post really isn’t meant to be a complete summary of the project. If you are interested, I recommend reading chapters 2 and 4 of &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf"&gt;my full dissertation (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="advice-for-my-past-self"&gt;Advice for my past-self&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three terms, my time log shows that I spent about &lt;em&gt;300 hours&lt;/em&gt; on the project. I got a grade of &lt;em&gt;69/100&lt;/em&gt; for my dissertation which I was pleased with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I still made plenty of mistakes. By far my biggest problem was &lt;em&gt;overconfidence&lt;/em&gt;. I had completed almost the entire program by the half-way point. I thought the data collection and analysis would be easy. I didn’t even start it until the beginning of the final term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn’t easy. It was one of the hardest and most time consuming parts of the project. Running simulations was a very slow process. My computer was probably running at max capacity for about three weeks straight. I did a pretty good job but I still feel that with a week extra, I could have gotten another 5-10 marks easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed about my dissertation is that plain English is &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt; for describing program structure. My project supervisor urged me to include some diagrams but I just ran out of time. I should have heeded his advice earlier and included a few really good diagrams to explain the MCTS algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through the source code, I also notice a lot of &lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/"&gt;code smells&lt;/a&gt;. Things like long methods, duplicated code, commented out code and lots of methods which do very similar things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it now, I do feel slightly embarrassed. It was my first ever major project and I didn’t really know what I was doing. At least I know better now, at least I like to think I do :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could only give one piece of advice to my past-self, it would be this: &lt;em&gt;Get it done ASAP&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/</guid> </item> <item><title>Changing my email address and updates to my CV</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;em&gt;new email address&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#064;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#120;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#121;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#064;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#120;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#121;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been running this blog for two and a half months but was still using my old Gmail address. Now that I’m thinking of applying for jobs, I want something that looks a bit more &lt;strong&gt;professional&lt;/strong&gt;. I think my new email address makes it pretty obvious that I have my own personal domain. I’m hoping that people will see it and think &lt;em&gt;“I guess that guy must know what he’s doing”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting it up was pretty easy. I’m already registered with &lt;a href="https://www.namecheap.com/"&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt; and they offer a relatively cheap email service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did have one slight problem. I had &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody"&gt;about 800 commits on my GitHub profile&lt;/a&gt; with my old Gmail address. I could have left them as they were (GitHub allows you to associate more than one email address with your account). However, I don’t think anyone else has cloned them yet and I wanted to have some degree of &lt;em&gt;consistency&lt;/em&gt; across all of my public commits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, GitHub provide instructions on how to &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/"&gt;change author info in published repositories&lt;/a&gt;. Their instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also made some minor modifications to &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/cv/"&gt;my CV&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing major. I just showed it to my Dad who gave me a few suggestions. I also added some more links to other posts on this blog. &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/my-experiences-playing-croquet/"&gt;I wrote about croquet on Friday&lt;/a&gt; and added a link to it in the “interests” section. Croquet has been a pretty big part of my life recently. I didn’t want to just say that without any &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; to back it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I plan to write about my two other major hobbies which I have yet to write about: cooking and photography. I have loads of photos to share (from both) and several interesting stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have done more this week. I feel mildly guilty about it. However, slow progress is far better than no progress and I can live with it. I have plans for this week including finally adding comments to this blog and going to Bristol again. I’ll write about that next week. &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/changing-my-email-address-and-updates-to-my-cv/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/changing-my-email-address-and-updates-to-my-cv/</guid> </item> <item><title>My experiences playing croquet</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t written about it before but I am a very keen croquet player. I thought I would share some of my experiences playing in matches over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="early-introduction-to-the-game"&gt;Early introduction to the game&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Dad first introduced me to croquet when I was about 15 years old. I started playing in my grandparents’ garden with a very basic wooden mallet. I enjoyed it a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/croquet-in-garden.jpg" alt="Croquet in my grandparents' garden" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="abbey-croquet-club"&gt;Abbey Croquet Club&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2005, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad went along and encouraged me to go. I enjoyed it and was persuaded to play in two matches. The first was at home, I think I won all of my games and was very pleased. Unfortunately, the second match was away (at Wells) and I lost all of my games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that second match really shattered my confidence. I stopped playing croquet for quite a while. I didn’t play at Cambridge even though I could have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="abbey-croquet-club-again"&gt;Abbey Croquet Club again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from university and came back home, I re-joined the club. It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). I played with my Dad and his friends for a while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then entered an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at that point and came in second place. That really boosted my confidence. I decided to buy my own mallet that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="first-year-of-matches"&gt;First year of matches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I started playing in matches again. I was very nervous. Thankfully, my first match of the season went very well. My Dad and I won our first two doubles games together which put me in good spirits. I then proceeded to win one and lose one game on my own. I felt like I had played well so I was content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that I started off playing with a handicap of 6 (minimum is 0 and maximum is 12). In the matches we were playing, the higher handicapped player gets a number of “free shots” equal to the difference in handicaps. It’s a relatively fair way of balancing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played in 4 matches that year. Out of my 12 singles games, I won 8, lost 2 and drew 2. I was very pleased with that. I was also improving constantly because of all the practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="second-year-of-matches"&gt;Second year of matches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My second year of matches went very well. Our team practised together &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the semi-final and then the final. We won the South West Handicap League for the first time ever. In that year, I won 21, lost 11 and drew 4. My handicap dropped to a 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-win-South-West-Handicap-Final/story-19912247-detail/story.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/bath-final.jpg" alt="Abbey winning the Golf Handicap League in Bath" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="association-croquet"&gt;Association croquet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should mention that all references to “croquet” so far have referring to “golf croquet”. There is another variation on the game called “association croquet”. I started playing association croquet that year. My Dad had taught me the basics a while ago and my golf croquet skills transferred across nicely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing in matches about half way through the season. I was nervous at the beginning but picked it up very quickly. That year, we won the South West Intermediate League for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-beat-Bath-win-South-West-title/story-19849150-detail/story.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/sidmouth-final.jpg" alt="Abbey winning the AC Intermediate League in Sidmouth" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="third-year-of-matches"&gt;Third year of matches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone up considerably. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say I was the best golf croquet player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone else I was playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a new rule that year. It meant that lower handicap players (like myself) had to give away even more free shots than normal. Despite the additional difficulty, I had my best season yet. I won 24 games and only lost 5. I also dropped to a 2 handicap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our whole team practised together a lot and improved even more. We also got a new team member. For the second year in a row, we won the South West Handicap League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-triumph-South-West-Handicap/story-23184624-detail/story.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/taunton-final.jpg" alt="Abbey winning the Golf Handicap League in Taunton" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our association croquet team also continued to improve. That year, we won the South West Federation League. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-win-South-West-Federation/story-23026871-detail/story.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/cheltenham-final.jpg" alt="Abbey winning the AC Federation League in Taunton" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I’m being completely honest, I was improving faster than my handicap was dropping. Association croquet games are longer than golf croquet games so you play fewer of them in a season. That meant my handicap was lagging behind my actual skill level. I do feel a bit guilty about that. Next year I plan to ask an official handicapper to drop my handicap to a more realistic level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="future-plans"&gt;Future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the croquet season has ended. We still play on weekends but it’s too cold and dark to play in the evenings. I am also planning to move away from Glastonbury soon so things must change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, I plan to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I’m also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still want to play in matches for Abbey but I am also planning to join a new club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the future will hold. Croquet is important to me but it is not my highest priority. One of the unfortunate things about croquet is that most players are much older than me. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/"&gt;2012 survey of croquet players&lt;/a&gt;, the median age is 65. Only 1% of croquet players are in their 20s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I plan to keep playing croquet for a long time to come. It’s a great game. &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/my-experiences-playing-croquet/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/my-experiences-playing-croquet/</guid> </item> <item><title>Lessons learned from a three year programming project (part 2)</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/lessons-learned-from-a-three-year-programming-project-part-1/"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary"&gt;view the project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="abstraction-and-small-methods"&gt;Abstraction and small methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lesson was something I learned slowly over the course of the project. I always “knew” the advantages of hiding implementation details in small methods. I had been taught it in university after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it came to actually writing code, I consistently ended up with massive unreadable functions. In my early Bash scripts for example, I had copy-pasted the code for iterating over all entries about &lt;em&gt;five different times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a while for me to &lt;em&gt;intuitively understand&lt;/em&gt; the concepts but I slowly got better. In my early versions, every single script depended on the exact same filesystem layout. In my current version, every single file depends on one &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; class which has many smaller methods. That class could change the filesystem layout any time it wants and it wouldn’t affect anything else. It could switch to a database or a remote filesystem and none of the other modules would notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"&gt;don’t repeat yourself&lt;/a&gt; principle (and its various corollaries) feels so &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; now. However, in practice, it still took me a long time to actually get to grips with what it really meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t repeat yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cli-and-polish"&gt;CLI and polish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on in development, I started thinking of new features to add. After creating the &lt;a href="http://professorp.co.uk/"&gt;professorp.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; website, I became interested in making a “local web app”. It would be a complete browser-based replacement for the command line app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I experimented with using Markdown conversion to create static HTML pages. I then created a working Flask RESTful API for manipulating entries as well as a very basic AngularJS web client. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided to scrap those ideas. There were an infinite number of features that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; add. However, they would all be a lot of work for little benefit. I realised I should focus on doing one thing and doing it well (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"&gt;Unix philosophy&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cleaned up the code even more and implemented a complete &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html"&gt;argparse&lt;/a&gt; command line parser. It ties together all the basic features of the program. It also adds enough documentation so that anyone could figure out how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did eventually adapt my previous ideas and implement a better static HTML generator. It allows things like pictures and videos to be embedded in entries. Its features slightly overlap with the basic command line functionality but not by as much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Write programs that do one thing and do it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="future-plans"&gt;Future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m very proud of my current diary program. I use it literally every single day. If I want to find out about some event that happened two years ago then I can often do it in a couple of seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, my constant &lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/"&gt;dogfooding&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in a very high quality program. However, in another way, it’s probably doomed it to obscurity. The structure of the program is very closely tied to how I like to work. Although it’s perfect for me, someone else might find it pointless or hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last three years, I have kept the project to myself. I have only just &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary"&gt;uploaded it to GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess time will tell whether anyone else is interested. Who knows, maybe it will become just as popular as &lt;a href="http://todotxt.com/"&gt;Todo.txt&lt;/a&gt; but I somehow doubt that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point I’m trying to make is that I should have sought external feedback much earlier. The project is mostly finished now. I don’t expect to make many major changes. If I had gotten feedback earlier in development then I may have learned some useful information about what others wanted and how to improve the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Release often and early.&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/lessons-learned-from-a-three-year-programming-project-part-2/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/lessons-learned-from-a-three-year-programming-project-part-2/</guid> </item> <item><title>First draft of my CV and a trip to Bristol</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/two-months-of-blogging/"&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt;, I said that Mondays would be about my job search. Here’s what I’ve done so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-first-draft-of-my-cv"&gt;The first draft of my CV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. It took me 8 Pomodoros (3 hours 20 minutes) to plan out and write. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up having more to put on than I thought. However, I’m still anxious that I don’t have &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; to show for my three years at home. Compared to any other recent graduate, I think I should look very good. However, compared to someone who graduated three years ago, I’m not so sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://davidxmoody.com/cv/"&gt;here is a link to my CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-trip-to-bristol"&gt;A trip to Bristol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve done any travelling by myself. Whenever I go anywhere, I’m usually with someone who knows what they are doing. Applying for jobs is probably going to involve getting to a lot of interviews. I thought it would be a good idea to re-familiarise myself with travelling by bus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, I went to Bristol on the bus (from Glastonbury). It went incredibly well. I found the whole experience very relaxing and not at all stressful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="getting-lost"&gt;Getting lost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I went, I looked at a map of Bristol. I set myself the “goal” of walking to the Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Bus Station. Approx 35 minutes walk according to Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to just set off and try to find my way there with nothing but my memory. In terms of actually navigating, it was a complete failure. I got pretty lost. I had printed out a map in case of emergencies but couldn’t even locate myself on it because it wasn’t detailed enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wondered, quite by accident, into a lovely little area called Brandon Hill Park. There was a tall tower with a winding staircase which I went up (Cabot Tower). For some reason, there were tons of ladybugs at the top. I spent a little while photographing them. Although I was totally lost, I was still having a great time. I had all day so I was happy to go slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/ladybugs-cabot-tower.jpg" alt="Ladybugs at the top of Cabot Tower" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I had read signposts telling me I was in Brandon Hill Park, I still had no idea where that was on the map. I thought I had wondered too far north. To find my way back, I headed towards the only major landmark I recognised: the river. Although it was fun just trying to use my own memory to navigate by, I had already been walking for over an hour and just wanted to get there. I figured out where I was on my map and planned a more direct route to the Clifton Suspension Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bridge was a pretty awesome sight. Very high above the river. I walked across it and back again and then sat down and rested on a nearby bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/clifton-suspension-bridge.jpg" alt="The Clifton Suspension Bridge" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I planned a more direct route back and set off. I got a sandwich to eat and had a brief look in the shops before catching the bus back home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A direct route to the bridge would have taken me just over an hour. However, I probably spent more like three and a half hours walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://davidxmoody.com/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/bristol-map-walk.jpg" alt="Map of my walk through Bristol" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed this trip. I’m pleased with how it went. It’s purpose was to re-introduce myself to travelling alone and in that respect it was a complete success. However, I realise that I can’t continue repeating the exact same trip. I want to make things difficult for myself. Now that I know I can easily handle the travelling, I want to start doing some more challenging activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I want to start going to some social events. I don’t know exactly what yet. I’ve been browsing &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/"&gt;meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; and have lots of ideas already. &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><link>http://davidxmoody.com/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidxmoody.com/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/</guid> </item> </channel> </rss>
