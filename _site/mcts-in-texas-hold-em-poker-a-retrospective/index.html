Both to prove I’ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.</p><p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold ‘em poker-bot</strong> which uses the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.</p><h2 id="how-to-build-a-poker-bot">How to build a poker-bot</h2><p>My poker-bot runs as a plugin to <a href="http://www.poker-academy.com/poker-software/">Poker Academy Pro</a>, a commercial program which can run custom bots written in Java. It also came with a nice little example poker-bot called SimpleBot. I based most of my dissertation around how well my poker-bot (MCTSBot) could play against SimpleBot.</p><p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/PAP1-800x.png" alt="Screenshot of Poker Academy Pro"/></p><p>I’m not going to write a complete description of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm in this post. If you are interested, you can check out chapters 2.4 and 2.5 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my dissertation (PDF)</a>.</p><p>For now, I’ll just say that it uses random simulations to gradually build up a partial game tree. It uses advanced strategies to find a balance between <em>exploring</em> new branches and <em>exploiting</em> the most promising branches.</p><p>I discovered that a decent <strong>opponent model</strong> was vital to the success of the program. An opponent model helps to predict what moves an opponent will make and increases the accuracy of simulations. To create one, I used <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a>, a handy set of open source machine learning algorithms. I would have loved to create my own machine learning algorithms but it would have been well beyond the scope of the project.</p><p>I also spent a lot of time creating tools to extract and analyse the data. I even wrote a simple graphical user interface which ran beside Poker Academy Pro. It displayed a <em>live view</em> of the expected values of each possible move as it was calculating them.</p><p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/GUI.png" alt="Screenshot of my GUI"/></p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>The purpose of my dissertation was not only to build a working poker-bot but also to analyse its performance in different situations. Again, I recommend you check out chapter 4 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my full dissertation (PDF)</a> for a proper explanation.</p><p>By the end of the project, my poker-bot was consistently able to beat SimpleBot. However, it was a tough battle to get there. The following graph shows MCTSBot’s performance with and without the two different opponent models I used (<strong>H</strong>and <strong>R</strong>ank <strong>O</strong>pponent <strong>M</strong>odel and <strong>N</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>ove <strong>O</strong>pponent <strong>M</strong>odel). It shows that both models were required to turn a positive average profit.</p><p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/SBvMB-oppmodels-v2.png" alt="Graph showing the effectiveness of different opponent models"/></p><p>I also explored how other parameters affected performance. Here is a quick graph of MCTSBot’s performance as its thinking time is varied.</p><p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/SBvMB-time.png" alt="Graph showing the effects of varying thinking time"/></p><p>Again, this blog post really isn’t meant to be a complete summary of the project. If you are interested, I recommend reading chapters 2 and 4 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my full dissertation (PDF)</a>.</p><h2 id="advice-for-my-past-self">Advice for my past-self</h2><p>Over three terms, my time log shows that I spent about <em>300 hours</em> on the project. I got a grade of <em>69/100</em> for my dissertation which I was pleased with.</p><p>However, I still made plenty of mistakes. By far my biggest problem was <em>overconfidence</em>. I had completed almost the entire program by the half-way point. I thought the data collection and analysis would be easy. I didn’t even start it until the beginning of the final term.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t easy. It was one of the hardest and most time consuming parts of the project. Running simulations was a very slow process. My computer was probably running at max capacity for about three weeks straight. I did a pretty good job but I still feel that with a week extra, I could have gotten another 5-10 marks easily.</p><p>Another thing I noticed about my dissertation is that plain English is <em>very bad</em> for describing program structure. My project supervisor urged me to include some diagrams but I just ran out of time. I should have heeded his advice earlier and included a few really good diagrams to explain the MCTS algorithm.</p><p>Looking through the source code, I also notice a lot of <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/">code smells</a>. Things like long methods, duplicated code, commented out code and lots of methods which do very similar things.</p><p>Looking back at it now, I do feel slightly embarrassed. It was my first ever major project and I didn’t really know what I was doing. At least I know better now, at least I like to think I do :)</p><p>If I could only give one piece of advice to my past-self, it would be this: <em>Get it done ASAP</em>.</p></article></div><div class="push"></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><p> <br> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davidxmoody">RSS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:david@davidxmoody.com">Email</a></p><p> This blog is available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 License</a></p> </footer><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-54505873-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
