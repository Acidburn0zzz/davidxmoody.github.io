    <h1>20 of my favourite cooking photos</h1>
    <p class="meta">Nov 7, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I started learning to cook in September 2011. I really enjoyed it. I learned from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>

<p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>

    <h1>My 10 best Tenerife photos</h1>
    <p class="meta">Oct 31, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In March of this year, I went on a family holiday with my parents to Tenerife. It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. </p>

<p>That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I’ve probably got about 50 very good ones but that’s too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.</p>

    <h1>MCTS in Texas Hold 'em Poker: A retrospective</h1>
    <p class="meta">Oct 29, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve recently been uploading a lot of my old projects. Both to prove I’ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.</p>

<p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold ‘em poker-bot</strong> which uses the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.</p>
