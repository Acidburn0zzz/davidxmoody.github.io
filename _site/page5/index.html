    <h1>A third attempt at Anki</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago. Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>. It&#8217;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>

<p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. </p>

    <h1>Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>. But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="http://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a> instead of <a href="http://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>

    <h1>Wordsearch game</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For my first post not about blogging, I thought I would return to my wordsearch game. I made it for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/">professorp.co.uk</a> website and I would say it&#8217;s the game I&#8217;m proudest of. I really like the simplicity and style of it. </p>

<p>In this post, I will take a look back at what I&#8217;ve already done and make a note of what I think could be improved. In subsequent posts, I plan to make some improvements and also make it into a standalone game.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>. There is one thing I particularly like about their RSS feed. It shows the first few paragraphs of the article followed by a link saying &#8220;Read X remaining paragraphs&#8221;. </p>

<p>If I can&#8217;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next best option. It has two big advantages: </p>

<ul>
  <li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to read the whole thing</li>
  <li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>
</ul>

    <p>I didn&#8217;t want to use an existing template for this blog. As a web programmer/designer, it would feel wrong not to make my own. </p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m not an artist. I&#8217;ve struggled with creating visually attractive content in the past. For my last project, <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>, I opted to use the default Bootstrap theme. I just wanted to get something up and running quickly.</p>

<p>This post will describe some of the things I&#8217;ve learned while creating this blog. </p>

    <p><em>I&#8217;m starting a blog.</em> </p>

<p>I want to contribute something back to the world. I&#8217;ve learned a lot over the past few years and I want to start sharing it. I may someday post articles about what I&#8217;ve already done (or upload it to my <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub profile</a>). For now though, I am going to write about what I&#8217;ve been interested in most recently: <strong>front end web development</strong>. </p>

<p>You can check out <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> to see my last project (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk">GitHube repo here</a>). It is a website for the Professor P series of children&#8217;s books and also includes <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">five JavaScript games</a>. </p>
