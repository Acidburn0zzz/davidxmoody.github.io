  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#8217;s about 7,000 words. </p>

<p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely ready but I also knew it didn&#8217;t matter. Now that I&#8217;ve been blogging for one month, it&#8217;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better. </p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This post will introduce a handy little Bash tip. I created it over a year ago but many other people have already done similar things.</p>

<p>Bash aliases are incredibly convenient. If, for some reason, you don&#8217;t already use them then you should <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions">read this tutorial</a>. </p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>

    <h1>Vim auto-capitalisation</h1>
    <p class="meta">Aug 29, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Continuing in the same theme as my <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">last post</a>, I am going to write about another awesome Vim tip I found recently. That is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>

<p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other text editors don&#8217;t usually have the option. I don&#8217;t know why. I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys. It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

    <h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
    <p class="meta">Aug 27, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I&#8217;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>

<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &#8220;I&#8217;ve&#8221; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I've</code>. That&#8217;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#8217;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

    <h1>My password generation scheme</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I&#8217;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows 95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>. I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior) <code>654321</code>. </p>

<p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#8217;s name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>
