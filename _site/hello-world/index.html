I’ve learned a lot over the past few years and I want to start sharing it. I may someday post articles about what I’ve already done (or upload it to my <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub profile</a>). For now though, I am going to write about what I’ve been interested in most recently: <strong>front end web development</strong>.</p><p>You can check out <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> to see my last project (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk">GitHube repo here</a>). It is a website for the Professor P series of children’s books and also includes <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">five JavaScript games</a>.</p><p>Why now? I don’t feel ready to start but <a href="http://jamesclear.com/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready">that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t start anyway</a>. I’ve spent a long time thinking about the trivial details of this blog. Things like what blogging platform to use and the visual style I want. However, I realised that none of that will ever matter if I don’t create some decent content. I’m going to keep the style as simple as possible and focus on the content first.</p><p>I recently re-read <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/">this excellent Coding Horror blog post</a>. Here is a quote:</p><blockquote><p>When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: <strong>pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.</strong></p></blockquote><p>My schedule will be <strong>three blog posts per week</strong>, on <em>Mondays</em>, <em>Wednesdays</em> and <em>Fridays</em>.</p><p>I want this blog to <em>eventually</em> be great. The best way for me to make that happen is to practise writing good content and the best way for <em>that</em> to happen is to set myself a schedule.</p></article></div></div><div class="push"></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><p> <br> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davidxmoody">RSS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:david@davidxmoody.com">Email</a></p><p> This blog is available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 License</a></p> </footer><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-54505873-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
