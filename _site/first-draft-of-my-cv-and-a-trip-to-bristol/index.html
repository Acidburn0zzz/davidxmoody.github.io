Here’s what I’ve done so far.</p><h2 id="the-first-draft-of-my-cv">The first draft of my CV</h2><p>Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. It took me 8 Pomodoros (3 hours 20 minutes) to plan out and write.</p><p>I ended up having more to put on than I thought. However, I’m still anxious that I don’t have <em>enough</em> to show for my three years at home. Compared to any other recent graduate, I think I should look very good. However, compared to someone who graduated three years ago, I’m not so sure.</p><p>Anyway, <a href="/cv/">here is a link to my CV</a>.</p><h2 id="a-trip-to-bristol">A trip to Bristol</h2><p>It’s been a while since I’ve done any travelling by myself. Whenever I go anywhere, I’m usually with someone who knows what they are doing. Applying for jobs is probably going to involve getting to a lot of interviews. I thought it would be a good idea to re-familiarise myself with travelling by bus.</p><p>Last Friday, I went to Bristol on the bus (from Glastonbury). It went incredibly well. I found the whole experience very relaxing and not at all stressful.</p><h2 id="getting-lost">Getting lost</h2><p>Before I went, I looked at a map of Bristol. I set myself the “goal” of walking to the Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Bus Station. Approx 35 minutes walk according to Google Maps.</p><p>I decided to just set off and try to find my way there with nothing but my memory. In terms of actually navigating, it was a complete failure. I got pretty lost. I had printed out a map in case of emergencies but couldn’t even locate myself on it because it wasn’t detailed enough.</p><p>I wondered, quite by accident, into a lovely little area called Brandon Hill Park. There was a tall tower with a winding staircase which I went up (Cabot Tower). For some reason, there were tons of ladybugs at the top. I spent a little while photographing them. Although I was totally lost, I was still having a great time. I had all day so I was happy to go slowly.</p><p><img src="/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/ladybugs-cabot-tower.jpg" alt="Ladybugs at the top of Cabot Tower"/></p><p>Although I had read signposts telling me I was in Brandon Hill Park, I still had no idea where that was on the map. I thought I had wondered too far north. To find my way back, I headed towards the only major landmark I recognised: the river. Although it was fun just trying to use my own memory to navigate by, I had already been walking for over an hour and just wanted to get there. I figured out where I was on my map and planned a more direct route to the Clifton Suspension Bridge.</p><p>The Bridge was a pretty awesome sight. Very high above the river. I walked across it and back again and then sat down and rested on a nearby bench.</p><p><img src="/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/clifton-suspension-bridge.jpg" alt="The Clifton Suspension Bridge"/></p><p>I planned a more direct route back and set off. I got a sandwich to eat and had a brief look in the shops before catching the bus back home.</p><p>A direct route to the bridge would have taken me just over an hour. However, I probably spent more like three and a half hours walking.</p><p><img src="/images/first-draft-of-my-cv-and-a-trip-to-bristol/bristol-map-walk.jpg" alt="Map of my walk through Bristol"/></p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>Overall, I really enjoyed this trip. I’m pleased with how it went. It’s purpose was to re-introduce myself to travelling alone and in that respect it was a complete success. However, I realise that I can’t continue repeating the exact same trip. I want to make things difficult for myself. Now that I know I can easily handle the travelling, I want to start doing some more challenging activities.</p><p>Specifically, I want to start going to some social events. I don’t know exactly what yet. I’ve been browsing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> and have lots of ideas already.</p></article></div><div class="push"></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><p> <br> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davidxmoody">RSS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:david@davidxmoody.com">Email</a></p><p> This blog is available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 License</a></p> </footer><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-54505873-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
