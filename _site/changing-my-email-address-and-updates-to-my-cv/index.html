Now that I’m thinking of applying for jobs, I want something that looks a bit more <strong>professional</strong>. I think my new email address makes it pretty obvious that I have my own personal domain. I’m hoping that people will see it and think <em>“I guess that guy must know what he’s doing”</em>.</p><p>Setting it up was pretty easy. I’m already registered with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> and they offer a relatively cheap email service.</p><p>I did have one slight problem. I had <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">about 800 commits on my GitHub profile</a> with my old Gmail address. I could have left them as they were (GitHub allows you to associate more than one email address with your account). However, I don’t think anyone else has cloned them yet and I wanted to have some degree of <em>consistency</em> across all of my public commits.</p><p>Thankfully, GitHub provide instructions on how to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/">change author info in published repositories</a>. Their instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly.</p><p>I also made some minor modifications to <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>. Nothing major. I just showed it to my Dad who gave me a few suggestions. I also added some more links to other posts on this blog. <a href="/my-experiences-playing-croquet/">I wrote about croquet on Friday</a> and added a link to it in the “interests” section. Croquet has been a pretty big part of my life recently. I didn’t want to just say that without any <em>evidence</em> to back it up.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, I plan to write about my two other major hobbies which I have yet to write about: cooking and photography. I have loads of photos to share (from both) and several interesting stories.</p><p>I could have done more this week. I feel mildly guilty about it. However, slow progress is far better than no progress and I can live with it. I have plans for this week including finally adding comments to this blog and going to Bristol again. I’ll write about that next week.</p></article></div><div class="push"></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><p> <br> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davidxmoody">RSS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:david@davidxmoody.com">Email</a></p><p> This blog is available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 License</a></p> </footer><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-54505873-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
