<h1>A specific plan for next week</h1>
<p><em>Nov 3, 2014</em></p>
</header>

<p>Three weeks ago, I wrote a <a href="/two-months-of-blogging/">two month review</a>. I said that I wanted to focus on <strong>getting a job</strong>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have certainly made some progress. I have written <a href="/cv/">my CV</a> (which I&#39;m very pleased with). I have also written a lot of blog posts which <em>support my CV</em>. By that, I mean I have written about many of the projects mentioned on my CV. I wanted to provide evidence that I&#39;d actually done them and show more examples of my work. </p>
<p>I&#39;m pleased with what I&#39;ve done but my job search is still going slower than I would like. I feel like I&#39;ve been procrastinating more than usual this last week because I <strong>didn&#39;t have a clear plan</strong>. I had finished writing my CV and didn&#39;t know what to do next. Simply saying &quot;get a job&quot; is far too vague. I need a better plan. </p>
<h2 id="a-better-plan">A better plan</h2>
<p>The following steps are what I think are <em>required</em> for me to get a job:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work</li>
<li>Apply to those places</li>
<li>Go to interviews</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, there are a few <em>bonus</em> steps which I think will increase the chances of me getting a better job:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue blogging (about programming topics in particular)</li>
<li>&quot;Interview practice&quot; (i.e. practise talking about my recent projects in front of a camera)</li>
<li>Continue travelling to Bristol and start going to meetups</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-next-step">The next step</h2>
<p>From the above plan, the clear and unambiguous next step is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work</li>
</ol>
<p>That will be the focus of this week. I am going to do a minimum of one Pomodoro per day on this task. By next week&#39;s post, I want to have a better understanding of what types of jobs are available in my field. I also want to identify 5 specific job openings that I could apply for. </p>
