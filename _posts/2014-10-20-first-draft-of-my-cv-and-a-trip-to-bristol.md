title: First draft of my CV and a trip to Bristol
---

[Last week](/two-months-of-blogging/), I said that Mondays would be about my job search. Here's what I've done so far.


## The first draft of my CV

Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. It took me 8 Pomodoros (3 hours 20 minutes) to plan out and write. 

I ended up having more to put on than I thought. However, I'm still anxious that I don't have *enough* to show for my three years at home. Compared to any other recent graduate, I think I should look very good. However, compared to someone who graduated three years ago, I'm not so sure. 

Anyway, [here is a link to my CV](/cv/).

## A trip to Bristol

I don't usually get out much by myself. I experience a lot of social anxiety and usually choose the easy option of staying at home. Recently, I've come to realise just how harmful this is. I'm never going to move on with my life unless I face up to my fears. I've written a lot about [the growth mindset](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/) recently. It's made me realise that there is only one way to improve. I have to start going out into the world and meeting people. 

However, I also want to break it down into small steps. Each step should be only slightly challenging but together they should accomplish something huge. For my first step, I thought I would re-familiarise myself with travelling by bus. 

I'd done three major bus trips by myself. One to Bristol to take my driving theory test. One bus and train trip to Hull to visit my grandparents. The final one was a bus trip to Bristol to go to a LessWrong meetup, about a year and a half ago. They were all pretty major events in my life, each doing something new which I was afraid of. 

Last Friday, I went to Bristol on the bus (from Glastonbury). I'm pleased to say that it went incredibly well. Despite it being a long time since I'd last been on the bus, I found the whole experience very relaxing and not at all stressful. I was not at all anxious which was pleasantly surprising. I think the reason for my lack of anxiety was the knowledge that I had done everything before, despite it being a while ago. 

## Getting lost

Before I went, I looked at a map of Bristol. I set myself the "goal" of walking to the Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Bus Station. Approx 35 minutes walk according to Google Maps. 

I decided to just set off and try to find my way there with nothing but my memory. In terms of actually navigating, it was a complete failure. I got pretty lost. I had printed out a map in case of emergencies but couldn't even locate myself on it because it wasn't detailed enough. 

I wondered, quite by accident, into a lovely little area called Brandon Hill Park. There was a tall tower with a winding staircase which I went up (Cabot Tower). For some reason, there were tons of ladybugs at the top. I spent a little while photographing them. Although I was totally lost, I was still having a great time. I had all day so I was happy to go slowly.

Although I had read signposts telling me I was in Brandon Hill Park, I still had no idea where that was on the map. I thought I had wondered too far north. To find my way back, I headed towards the only major landmark I recognised: the river. Although it was fun just trying to use my own memory to navigate by, I had already been walking for over an hour and just wanted to get there. I figured out where I was on my map and planned a more direct route to the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

The Bridge was a pretty awesome sight. Very high above the river. I walked across it and back again and then sat down and rested on a nearby bench.

I planned a more direct route back and set off. I got a sandwich to eat and had a brief look in the shops before catching the bus back home. 

A direct route to the bridge would have taken me just over an hour. However, I probably spent more like three and a half hours walking.

## Conclusions

Overall, I really enjoyed this trip. I'm pleased with how it went. It's purpose was to re-introduce myself to travelling alone and in that respect it was a complete success. However, I realise that I can't continue repeating the exact same trip. I want to make things difficult for myself. Now that I know I can easily handle the travelling, I want to start doing some more challenging activities. 

Specifically, I want to start going to some social events. I don't know exactly what yet. I'm thinking something similar to the previous LessWrong meetup I went to. I've been browsing [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) and have lots of ideas already.
