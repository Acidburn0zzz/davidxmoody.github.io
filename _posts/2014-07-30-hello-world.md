So I've been procrastinating on starting a blog for far too long. I first got the idea about two years ago but never pursued it. About a week ago I finished my last significant project and decided that this time I was definitely going to start a blog. I've spent the last week "researching" how best to do it but this is the first thing I've actually written. 

I just re-read [this excellent post on the Coding Horror blog](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/). You should probably go read that instead of this but I feel the most important point is this:

> When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: **pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.**

I've spent the last week trying to decide about trivial details. Things like what blogging platform to use and the visual style I want. All of that can be sorted out later. For now I'm just going to write using Jekyll, GitHub Pages and the default theme provided by Jekyll. 

There is no point in having the perfect responsive design if I don't have any worthwhile content. No-one is going to read this blog if I never write anything so it's kind of silly to focus on the visual design first. I'm going to focus on the content and then tweak the layout later. Customising the design of this site could be an excellent thing to write about anyway. 

In summary, I'm going to just start writing. Hardly anyone is going to be reading these early blog posts anyway. They are mostly just for my own benefit, so I can practise writing.
