title: A specific plan for next week
---

Three weeks ago, I wrote a [two month review](/two-months-of-blogging/). I said that I wanted to focus on **getting a job**.


I have certainly made some progress. I have written [my CV](/cv/) (which I'm very pleased with). I have also written a lot of blog posts which *support my CV*. By that, I mean I have written about many of the projects mentioned on my CV. I wanted to provide evidence that I'd actually done them and show more examples of my work. 

I'm pleased with what I've done but my job search is still going slower than I would like. I feel like I've been procrastinating more than usual this last week because I **didn't have a clear plan**. I had finished writing my CV and didn't know what to do next. Simply saying "get a job" is far too vague. I need a better plan. 

## A better plan

The following steps are what I think are *required* for me to get a job:

1. Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work
2. Apply to those places
3. Go for interviews

Additionally, there are a few *bonus* steps which I think will increase the chances of me getting a better job:

- Continue blogging (about programming topics in particular)
- "Interview practice" (i.e. practise talking about my recent projects in front of a camera)
- Continue travelling to Bristol and start going to meetups

## The next step

From the above plan, the clear and unambiguous next step is:

1. Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work

That will be the focus of this week. I am going to do a minimum of one Pomodoro per day on this task. By next week's post, I want to have a better understanding of what types of jobs are available in my field. I also want to identify 5 specific job openings that I could apply for.
