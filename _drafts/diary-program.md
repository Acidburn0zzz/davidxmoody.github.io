TODO add github link

In this post, I'm going to talk about my longest running pet project. It started out as a simple set of Bash scripts (in 2011) and has gone through several major re-writes. It is now a complete Python command line application with many useful features. I use it every single day. 


## Motivation

Back in September 2010 I read an excellent book called [59 Seconds by Richard Wiseman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/59-Seconds-Richard-Wiseman-ebook/dp/B003GUBINE/). One of the things it suggested was keeping a regular diary/journal. 

Now, there are a lot of good things to be said for writing regularly. [This Lifehacker post](http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-keep-a-journal-and-how-to-start-yours-1547057185) is a pretty good introduction. Or you could just do a [Google search for the benefits of writing a diary](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=benefits+of+writing+a+diary). 

This post is going to focus on the software I created to solve some of the problems I was having.
