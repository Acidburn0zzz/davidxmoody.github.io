title: Typing vs handwriting
---

I like to write a lot. I've already written over ten thousand words on this blog. Several of my previous posts have even been about how to write faster with Vim tricks. I also write a lot in my own diary and on paper to plan out my blog posts.

For something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had by making the process more efficient. I want to experiment and gather data about my writing in order to better understand the process. 


## A brief history of my writing

My early history with writing is pretty much like everyone else. I went to primary school, secondary school, college and university. I did plenty of handwriting in each but only a little typing. I learned cursive handwriting in primary school and stuck with it the entire time because it was all I knew. 

In my final year of university, I started keeping a diary. It was a slow start but I eventually fell in love with it and couldn't stop myself writing more and more. I switched from a hunt and peck Qwerty typing method to touch typing with Dvorak. I practised constantly and got faster and faster. As of right now, I have written 1,131,608 words in my diary. That's tons. At 40 words per minute, that's about 500 hours of typing practice from my diary alone.

In the future, I see most of my writing focussing around this blog. I've only been going a month and a half but I already know that I want to continue for the rest of my life.

## Let's experiment

I wanted to gather some data on my actual writing speeds in different formats. For my first experiment, I typed out the entire text of my [first ever entry](/hello-world/). Here are the results:

- Typing: 3m 54s (**72 wpm**)
- SwiftKey: 7m 40s (**37 wpm**)
- Handwriting (messy): 11m 00s (**26 wpm**)
- Handwriting (neat): 14m 50s (**19 wpm**)

Obviously, typing in Dvorak and Vim blows everything else out of the water. With SwiftKey, I use the Dvorak layout with two thumbs and it's pretty quick. I was surprised at the difference between my "messy handwriting" and "neat handwriting". The first was mostly cursive with no care taken for readability. The second was printed very neatly (i.e. not joined up). 

The difference between messy and neat handwriting surprised me. I was curious as to whether it was writing in cursive that was boosting my speed or simply writing with less care. I did another test, this time with the first four paragraphs of my [growth mindset post](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/).

- Typing: 2m 56s (**72 wpm**)
- SwiftKey: 5m 19s (**40 wpm**)
- Handwriting (printed): 8m 40s (**24 wpm**)
- Handwriting (cursive): 8m 56s (**24 wpm**)

## Improvements

Dvorak and Vim will always be my main method for writing. It's just so quick and efficient. I have previously written about [how to automatically capitalise the first letter in each sentence with Vim](/vim-auto-capitalisation/) and [how to use better Vim abbreviations](/better-vim-abbreviations/). I plan to continue investigating Vim add-ons and tips. For something I do so much of, these small gains really add up. 

I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast SwiftKey is. It's also very easy to use, requiring less effort to type than a proper keyboard. However, it's very bad at certain types of task. For example, editing text or anything with complex punctuation.
