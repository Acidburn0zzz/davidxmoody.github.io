M starting a blog.

I want to contribute something back to the world. I've learned a lot over the past few years and I want to start sharing it. I may someday post articles about what I've already done (or upload it to my GitHub profile). For now though, I am going to write about what I've been interested in most recently: front end web development. 

You can check out professorp.co.uk to see my last project (GitHub repo here). It is a website for the Professor P series of children's books and also includes five JavaScript games. 

Why now? I don't feel ready to start but that doesn't mean I shouldn't start anyway. I've spent a long time thinking about the trivial details of this blog. Things like what blogging platform to use and the visual style I want. However, I realised that none of that will ever matter if I don't create some decent content. I'm going to keep the style as simple as possible and focus on the content first. 

I recently re-read this excellent Coding Horror blog post. Here is a quote:

When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter. 

My schedule will be three blog posts per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 

I want this blog to eventually be great. The best way for me to make that happen is to practise writing good content and the best way for that to happen is to set myself a schedule.
