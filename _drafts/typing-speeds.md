title: Typing vs handwriting
---

I like to write a lot. I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had. I want to *better understand how I write* in the hope that it might make me more efficient at writing.


## A brief history of my writing

The first 20 years of my life were pretty normal. I learned cursive handwriting in primary school and basic typing skills in secondary school. 

In my final year of university, I started keeping a diary. I fell in love with it. I couldn't stop myself from writing. I learned to touch type with the Dvorak keyboard layout. As of right now, I have written **1,131,772 words** in my diary. That's tons. At an average of 40 words per minute, that's about **500 hours** of typing practice. 

I have also written thousands of pages of A4 in my lifetime. I like the different options that pen and paper brings. 

In the future, I want to focus my writing on *this blog*. I have recently switched from a typing-only approach to planning on paper first. I found that when I started typing right away, I ended up having to discard too much of what I had written. I think that having a clear plan before you start is incredibly helpful. Planning could be done with a keyboard but writing on paper helps to reduce the stress on my fingers. 

## Let's experiment

I wanted to gather some data on my actual writing speeds in different formats. For my first experiment, I typed out the entire text of my [first ever blog post](/hello-world/). 

- Typing: 3m 54s (**72 wpm**)
- SwiftKey: 7m 40s (**37 wpm**)
- Handwriting (messy): 11m 00s (**26 wpm**)
- Handwriting (neat): 14m 50s (**19 wpm**)

Obviously, typing in Dvorak and Vim blows everything else out of the water. With [SwiftKey for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey), I use the Dvorak layout with two thumbs and it's pretty quick. I was surprised at the difference between my "messy handwriting" and "neat handwriting". The first was mostly cursive with no care taken for readability. The second was printed very neatly (i.e. not joined up). 

I was curious as to whether it was writing in cursive that was boosting my speed or simply writing with less care. I did another test, this time with the first four paragraphs of my [growth mindset post](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/).

- Typing: 2m 56s (**72 wpm**)
- SwiftKey: 5m 19s (**40 wpm**)
- Handwriting (printed): 8m 40s (**24 wpm**)
- Handwriting (cursive): 8m 56s (**24 wpm**)

That's more in line with my expectations, I think the previous gap was due to care taken and not the handwriting style. My own personal results can be summed up with the ratio **1:2:3:4** for typing, SwiftKey, messy handwriting and neat handwriting. 

## Conclusions

Dvorak and Vim will always be my main method for writing. It's just so quick and efficient. I have previously written about [Vim auto-capitalisation](/vim-auto-capitalisation/) and [better Vim abbreviations](/better-vim-abbreviations/). I will continue to look at Vim add-ons and tips. For something I do so much of, these small gains really add up. 

I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast SwiftKey is. It's also very easy to use, requiring less effort to type than a proper keyboard. However, it's very bad at certain types of task. For example, editing text or anything with complex punctuation. I'm glad I can type so fast with SwiftKey but I don't see myself using it for much proper work. It will always be handy for quick emails or text messages though. 

Writing on paper will always be slower than typing. That's fine. One of the main benefits of paper is that it allows me to write without over-stressing my fingers. I also still like the ability to draw ad-hoc diagrams and use different colours. 

I think the biggest area for handwriting improvement is skipping out the unnecessary bits. I try to write the fewest number of words that get the message across. Abbreviations can also help. In the future, I would like to investigate more advanced abbreviation systems. I'm also interested in [Gregg shorthand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand). Even if I don't stick with it, I might learn a thing or two about how to write more quickly.
