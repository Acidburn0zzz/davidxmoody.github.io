For my first proper post, I thought I would return to my HTML/JavaScript wordsearch game project. I made it for the [professorp.co.uk](http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/) website and I would say it's the game I'm proudest of. I really like the simplicity and style of it. 

In this post I will take a look back at what I've already done and make a note of what I think could be improved. In subsequent posts I will make some improvements and also make it into a standalone game which can exist outside of the Professor P website.
