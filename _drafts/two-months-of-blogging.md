title: Two months of blogging
---

I've now been blogging for about two months. In that time, I've written 19 posts or about 12,000 words. After my first month, [I reviewed my progress](/one-month-of-blogging/) and adjusted my plan for the future. Now it's time to do it again. 


## A shift in topics

There is a big difference between the posts I wrote in my second month compared to my first. They are mostly about *non-programming stuff*. Now, I'm very happy to write about *some* personal stuff. However, I still want to write about programming. After all, the tag-line for this blog is supposed to be "A blog about programming". 

In the future, I want a *better spread* of topics. I fear that by writing too much about personal topics, I risk *not being interesting* to readers. 

## A shift in writing habits

In my second month, I changed from three posts per week to two per week. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I ended up spending more time on each post. I think the quality has generally gone up because of that. 

I also adopted the new habit of planning out posts on paper before typing them up. I like this new habit and plan to continue. I think a proper plan stops me going off-topic too much. 

## What I've been doing when I haven't been blogging

Although I've recently started writing about myself, I still haven't said anything about what I've been doing when I haven't been blogging. 

I'm still living at home with my parents. In the year before I started this blog, I was working on the [professorp.co.uk](http://www.professorp.co.uk/) website. 

About six weeks ago, we found out that my Dad (author of the [Professor P books](http://www.professorp.co.uk/books/)) had to move out of his office. The plan was for him to take over my work room in the house. Unfortunately, we had a *lifetime* worth of possessions around the house which needed to be sorted. I've spent much of the last six weeks sorting through and selling everything we didn't need. Stuff like furniture, books, toys and everything that my family has bought over the last 20+ years.

Oh, and we also won two croquet league finals. I haven't written about croquet yet but I definitely plan to. Here is a [link to a newspaper article from the Association Croquet South West Federation final](http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-win-South-West-Federation/story-23026871-detail/story.html). We also won the Golf Croquet Handicap League final (will add a link when it becomes available). Naturally, croquet matches and practice have taken up a lot of my time lately. 

## My goals for the future

Anyway, we have nearly finished sorting out the house and the croquet season has ended. That's going to leave me with a lot more free time. I've been thinking about it for a while and there is only one thing I think I should be working on: getting a job. 

I've been procrastinating for three years. Admittedly I have done some incredibly valuable stuff in that time but still. 

The power of public commitment is very strong. It's helped me stick to my blogging schedule, even when it's been hard. I now want to start writing about the process of getting a job. 

## A new schedule

Two posts per week has been fine but I'm going to try something different for my next month of blogging. I want to bring this blog back to the topic of programming. I also want to start writing about jobs and I also want to continue writing about other things which don't fit into those categories. 

Starting *Wednesday 15 October 2014*, my new schedule will be:

- **Mondays:** A post about my job search
- **Wednesdays:** A post about programming
- **Fridays:** A post about whatever I like
