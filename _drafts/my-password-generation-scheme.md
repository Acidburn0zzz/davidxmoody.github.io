title: My password generation scheme
---

I've been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows 98 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was `1234`. I later upgraded to `123456` and then the (clearly far superior) `654321`. 

At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat's name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a `1` to the end.


As I became more tech-savvy, I slowly started strengthening my passwords.
