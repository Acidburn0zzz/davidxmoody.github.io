title: A little bit about me
---

I've now written ten reasonably substantial posts for this blog. Somehow I haven't written anything about myself yet. 

When I started this blog, I just wanted to get a lot of practice writing. It's been going well. 


- Who am I, why nothing so far
- Picture?
- Short history:
    - secondary school/college
    - Cambridge and switching to computer science
    - three years at home, learning Linux/Python/Bash/JavaScript/CoffeeScript 
- Other interests?
