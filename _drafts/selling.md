title: Selling my childhood toys on eBay and Amazon
---

I mentioned in my [two months of blogging post](/two-months-of-blogging/#what-ive-been-doing-when-i-havent-been-blogging) that I've been selling a lot of my old possessions on eBay and Amazon. Over the last couple of years, I have sold literally TODO things on eBay and TODO things on Amazon. I thought I'd share a few of my thoughts on how the process has been going.

## When is it worth it?

Selling things on eBay and Amazon is pretty efficient. The eBay Android app is very good and creating a listing on Amazon takes no time at all. However, when you are selling a lot of things, the time quickly adds up. 

When things go well, it can take about 3 minutes to list something on Amazon or 10 for eBay. It takes about 3 minutes to print a shipping label and package something up. Then sending it via the post office or Collect+ can take only a few minutes if I was passing by anyway. For more complex items those estimates could be doubled or even quadrupled. 

You could calculate your effective "hourly wage" if you wanted to. Personally, I find it quite satisfying to get rid of something I don't need and help out someone else. Still, as a rule of thumb, I don't even consider selling anything worth less than £5. It goes straight to the charity shop or gets bundled together with similar items. 

## Pricing strategies

For Amazon, I always price everything just under the next lowest used price. If I don't do that, I find that things can sit on Amazon for ages never selling. If there are no other used versions of the product on sale then I usually go for around 75% or less of the new price.

For eBay, I put almost everything on for 99p. I've come to trust that almost always leads to a fair sale price. For very rare or unusual items I occasionally put higher starting prices. The situation you don't want to occur is for only one person to be interested but also willing to pay a high amount. Even if they bid £50, you may only end up with 99p if no-one else was interested. 

## Collection in person

I was pretty nervous about selling things with local collection on eBay. However, I've had a lot of positive experiences and no negative ones. For simple things, the buyer just rings your bell and takes the item. 

I've also had several instances of people wanting other things I was going to sell but hadn't gotten around to yet.

## Closing thoughts

It's been a good experience. It's also made me realise that buying used can be just as good as buying new.
