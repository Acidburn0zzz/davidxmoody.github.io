title: Music for programming

Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It helps to drown out distractions and get you into the right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.


## Grooveshark broadcasts

[Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/) is pretty great. It offers an incredibly easy to use streaming service. It runs in the browser and is completely free. 

I like the [broadcasts](http://grooveshark.com/#!/broadcasts) section. It's essentially user-created radio stations. [Programming Electronic & Alternative](http://grooveshark.com/#!/writhem/broadcast) is very good. Any other EDM broadcast without vocals is usually pretty good too. 

I also think it's worth creating a Grooveshark account so that you can favourite tracks you like. I have enough music in my list to be able to use it as a decent playlist for programming. 

## musicForProgramming();

[musicForProgramming();](http://musicforprogramming.net/) is another source of free music meant to aid concentration. I like it. There is a lot of interesting music on there. 

However, I also think there is a bit much silence mixed in with the tracks. I find that when there is too much silence, background noises suddenly become distracting again. It's still worth checking out though, especially if you are already working in a quiet environment. 

## Get Work Done Music

[Get Work Done Music](http://www.getworkdonemusic.com/) is another free and very simple streaming service. It has just two options: "Fast" and "Faster". It serves up music from Soundcloud suitable for working. I really like it. 

## Assassin's Creed 2 OST

[Here's another article about music for programming](http://ryanio.com/2014/music-to-get-work-done/) which inspired this article. One of my (now favourite) albums was taken straight from it. It's the [Assassin's Creed 2 soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH1wfrOcvHg). 

I think I've literally listened to it over 50 times now. Hearing it again instantly brings up memories of working on the [professorp.co.uk](http://professorp.co.uk/) website. I find it has *exactly* the right balance of enough sound to drown out background noise, sounding great and not being *too* distracting. 

## Shatter OST

Another of my absolute favourite video game soundtracks is [Shatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxP7VBbhRaw). I originally got it from one of the [Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/) and it's become one of my favourite albums of all time. 

The only bad thing I can say about it is that it's **too damn good**. I occasionally find myself getting distracted from my work because I just can't stop nodding my head.

## OverClocked ReMix

Yet another fantastic source of free music is [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/). It has tons of great video game soundtrack remixes. 

Unfortunately, you can't actually stream from them which makes discovering new music quite hard. Every now and then, I download a new album at random. Some are great, some are okay. My two favourites are:

- [Audio Engineering: A Tribute to Cid](http://ocremix.org/album/54/audio-engineering-a-tribute-to-cid)
- [Mega Man X: Maverick Rising](http://ocremix.org/album/37/mega-man-x-maverick-rising)

## Other tips

When you are listening to music all day long, you really have to be careful. I know from experience that listening to music which is too loud for too long can *absolutely give you a terrible headache*. 

The best way to avoid that is to simply listen at a lower volume. Lower than you would normally listen to music at. 

Of course, higher-quality noise isolating headphones can help. By blocking out external noise, they allow you to listen at lower volumes while still being able to hear the music properly. 

With my laptop and phone, I use [these SoundMAGIC E10 Earphones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005HP3OB0). I've had them just over three months and they are the best earphones I've ever used. Both the sound quality and design is excellent. At Â£30, they aren't super cheap but they are still cheap enough that I don't worry about carrying them in my pocket without protection. 

For my standing desk, I use [these Bluedio Bluetooth headphones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ADJG95I). I've tried a lot of different headphones over the last few years. I've found that for a *standing desk*, absolutely nothing can beat the convenience of wireless. The freedom of movement they offer is more important than anything else. They are falling to pieces a little bit. I think that's partly due to a year of hard use and partly due to weak plastic. I would buy them again but I'm also interested in looking for alternatives.
