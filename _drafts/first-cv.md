title: First draft of my CV and a trip to Bristol
---

Last week in my [two months review](/two-months-of-blogging/), I said that Mondays would be about my job search. Here's what I've been doing over the last week.


## The first draft of my CV

Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. It took me 8 Pomodoros (3 hours 20 minutes) to plan out and write. 

I ended up having more to put on than I thought. However, I'm still anxious that I don't have *enough* to show for my three years at home. Compared to any recent graduate, I think I should look very good. However, compared to someone who graduated three years ago, I'm not so sure. 

Anyway, [here is a link to my CV](/cv/).

## A trip to Bristol

Although this isn't literally looking for a job, it's highly related. I don't get out much by myself. Most of the time, I either go places with my family or go to places I've already been to. To escape my social anxiety, I simply avoided most social situations. For most of my life, I did this without really realising how damaging it was. I've recently realised that I can't keep doing it. However much anxiety I have to suffer through, it will be worth it. 


I don't usually get out much by myself. I experience a lot of social anxiety and usually choose the easy option of staying at home. Recently, I've come to realise just how harmful this is. I'm never going to move on with my life unless I face up to my fears. I've written a lot about [the growth mindset](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/) recently. It's made me realise that there is only one way to improve. I have to start going out into the world and meeting people. 

However, I also want to break it down into small steps. I want to split it into activities which, by themselves are only slightly challenging but together accomplish something which would have otherwise been impossible. For my first step, I thought I would re-familiarise myself with travelling by bus. 

I'd done three major bus trips by myself. One to Bristol to take my driving theory test. One bus and train trip to Hull to visit my grandparents. One bus trip to Bristol to go to a LessWrong meetup. They were all pretty major events in my life, each doing something new which I was afraid of. The last one was over a year and a half ago. 

Last Friday, I went to Bristol on the bus (from Glastonbury). I'm pleased to say that it all went incredibly well. Despite it being a long time since I'd last been on the bus, I found the whole experience very relaxing and not at all stressful. I was not in the slightest bit anxious which was pleasantly surprising. I think the reason for my lack of anxiety was the knowledge that I had done everything before. 

Before I went, I looked at a map of Bristol. I set myself the "goal" of walking to the Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Bus Station. Approx 35 minutes walk according to Google Maps. I printed out a basic map but was otherwise completely on my own. I wanted to set myself a goal to give myself something to do and stop myself getting bored.

I decided to just set off and try to find my way there with nothing but my memory of the map. In terms of actually navigating, it was a complete failure. I got pretty lost. I tried to find myself on the map I had printed out but couldn't because it hardly had any of the street names on it. 

I wondered, quite by accident, into a lovely little area called Brandon Hill Park. There was a tall tower with a winding staircase which I went up (Cabot Tower). For some reason, there were tons of ladybugs at the top. I spent a little while photographing them. Although I was totally lost, I was still having a great time. I had no time limits so I was happy to go slowly.

Although I had read signposts telling me I was in Brandon Hill Park, I still had no idea where that was on the map. I thought I had wondered too far north. To find my way back, I headed towards the only major landmark I recognised: the river. I eventually managed to figure out where I was on the map. Although it was fun just trying to use my own memory to navigate by, I had already been walking well over an hour and just wanted to get there. I planned a more direct route to the Clifton Suspension Bridge and set off once again. 

The Bridge was a pretty awesome sight. Very high above the river below. I walked across it and back again and then sat down next to the Clifton Observatory. 

I planned a more direct route back and set off. I got a sandwich to eat and had a brief look in the shops before catching the bus back home. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this trip. I'm pleased with how it went. It's purpose was to re-introduce myself into travelling alone and in that respect it's been a complete success. However, I realise that I can't continue repeating the exact same trip. I want to make things difficult for myself. Now I know I can easily handle the travelling, I want to start doing some more challenging activities. 

Specifically, I want to start going to some social events. I don't know exactly what yet. I'm thinking something exactly like the previous LessWrong meetup I went to. I've been browsing [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) and have found some very interesting meetups. My next trip will involve something like that.
