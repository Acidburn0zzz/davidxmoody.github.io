I have now published three posts a week for the last four weeks. I have managed to successfully stick to my original schedule which I'm quite proud of. In this post, I am going to review what I've already done and lay out a plan for the future.


## A delayed start

Looking through my [Git repository](https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.github.io/commits/master), I see that I started working on my [first post](/hello-world/) nearly two weeks before I published it. In my first draft, I wrote a very "apologetic" post. I was using the default Jekyll style and said I just wanted to start writing before trying to improve it. 

I was going to publish that straight away but chickened out. Instead, I wrote a post on [my wordsearch game](/wordsearch-game/). I should have published that straight away but again I delayed. 

I then removed the default Jekyll style and made my own. I wrote [a post about it](/creating-a-style-for-this-blog/) and then [another post](/paragraph-counts-in-jekyll/). 

Only then was I ready to publish my blog. I finally uploaded it to GitHub and redirected the [davidxmoody.com](http://davidxmoody.com/) domain name to point to it. 

## Sticking to a schedule

I had set myself the schedule of three posts per week (on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) and intended to stick to it. So instead of publishing all my posts at once, I only published the first one and held the rest in reserve. I'm incredibly pleased I did that. It gave me a large safety net and meant I didn't have to worry about deadlines too much. 

As time passed, I started using up my buffer faster than I was replenishing it. I was still doing pretty well up until my eighth post. I wrote the majority of that post on the day I published it. Similarly for my ninth and tenth posts. I feel the quality definitely suffered a bit because of that. Being able to leave your work for a day or two and revisit it with fresh eyes definitely helps. 

For my own benefit, here is a list of all my post with an approximate number of days between the date I finished it and the date I published it:

- [Hello world](/hello-world/) (10 days)
- [Creating a style for this blog](/creating-a-style-for-this-blog/) (4 days)
- [Paragraph counts in jekyll](/paragraph-counts-in-jekyll/) (6 days)
- [Wordsearch game](/wordsearch-game/) (13 days)
- [Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains](/namecheap-github-pages-and-apex-domains/) (2 days)
- [A third attempt at Anki](/a-third-attempt-at-anki/) (4 days)
- [My password generation scheme](/my-password-generation-scheme/) (13 days)
- [Better Vim abbreviations](/better-vim-abbreviations/) (0 days)
- [Vim auto-capitalisation](/vim-auto-capitalisation/) (1 day)
- TODO
