title: One month of blogging
---

I have now published three posts a week for the last four weeks. That's about 7,000 words. 

When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew that I would never be completely ready but I also knew it didn't matter. Now that I've been blogging for one month, it's time for a review. I want to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better. 


## Sticking to a schedule

Looking through my [Git repository](https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.github.io/commits/master), I see that I started working on my first post nearly two weeks before I published it. I delayed for so long because I doubted my ability to stick with it. I didn't want my blog to end up like most programmer's blogs, with only a handful of posts dated a year ago. I wrote another three full posts before I published my first. 

I set myself the schedule of publishing three posts per week. Near the beginning, this was easy because I had already built up a large buffer of unpublished posts. As time passed, I became lazy. I relied on that buffer too much and watched it slowly diminish. By my eighth post, I had nothing left and ended up writing most of it on the same day I published it.

The quality definitely suffered. Being able to leave your work for a day or two and revisit it with fresh eyes really helps. 

For my own benefit, here is a list of every post on this blog with the number of days between the date it was finished and the date it was published. 

- [Hello world](/hello-world/) (10 days)
- [Creating a style for this blog](/creating-a-style-for-this-blog/) (4 days)
- [Paragraph counts in jekyll](/paragraph-counts-in-jekyll/) (6 days)
- [Wordsearch game](/wordsearch-game/) (13 days)
- [Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains](/namecheap-github-pages-and-apex-domains/) (2 days)
- [A third attempt at Anki](/a-third-attempt-at-anki/) (4 days)
- [My password generation scheme](/my-password-generation-scheme/) (13 days)
- [Better Vim abbreviations](/better-vim-abbreviations/) (0 days)
- [Vim auto-capitalisation](/vim-auto-capitalisation/) (1 day)
- [Music for programming](/music-for-programming/) (0 days)
- [Permanent Bash aliases](/permanent-bash-aliases/) (1 day)
- [One month of blogging](/one-month-of-blogging/) (??? days)

I really wish I'd given myself another couple of days for some of my later posts. Looking back at the Vim posts, I can spot a lot of small things I would change. 

One specific thing I have noticed is that I tend to talk about myself too much. In the first two paragraphs of the [Vim auto-capitalisation](/vim-auto-capitalisation/) post, I used the pronoun "I" four times when none of them were necessary. 

It kind of reminds me of [this LessWrong post on Trying to Try](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uh/trying_to_try/). This is my blog, it should be taken as granted that anything written here is my opinion. If I write "Vim is awesome" then that should be interpreted as my opinion of Vim. It's completely unnecessary to write "I think Vim is awesome". It adds more words and makes it feel like I'm not certain of my own opinion. I want to get myself to write "I think" and "I feel" less on this blog. 

When I only have one or two days to write a post, I feel like I can't attempt more ambitious projects. I have lots of [ideas](https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.github.io/blob/master/_ideas.md) for posts. However, I know that many of them will require more time for research. I don't want to attempt something difficult if I don't think I can be certain of finishing it within the deadline.
