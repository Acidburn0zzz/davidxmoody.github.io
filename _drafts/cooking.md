title: 10 of my favourite cooking photos
---

I first started learning to cook in September 2011. It was a lot of fun. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing up until then and made lots of mistakes. My Mum taught me what she knew and I also learned from books and TV. 

I have been cooking for my family ever since then. At times, I was making a new recipe almost every day for months on end. 

I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty of good ones and I thought I would share a few.
