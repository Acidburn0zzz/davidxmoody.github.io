title: A third attempt at Anki
---

I first found out about [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) ages ago. Probably about four years ago on [LessWrong](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition). It is a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. 


A lot of very smart people had said a lot of very good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have not yet had much success. 

## My first attempt

About three years ago I decided to give it a try. At the time, I wanted to learn the Java standard library better. I remember installing it and looking for shared decks. There were quite a lot but most were not very good. It felt like most were created by students taking "Introduction to Java" classes. Despite that, I downloaded them anyway. I tried to use them but I lost interest pretty quickly.

Shortly after, I abandoned Anki for the first time. I feel the mistakes I made here are pretty obvious:

- Most of the cards were either too easy, too trivial or just not useful
- I did not *fully* understand the content of the Anki cards before trying to learn from them
- Although I made a few of my own cards, I did not get into the habit of it so I failed to remember new information

## My second attempt

About a year and a half ago, I wanted to try it again. I had learned from my previous attempt. I knew not to simply use existing cards and that I had to make my own. 

I got into the habit of finding a tutorial on a subject I wanted to learn about and writing notes on the important points. I would then later go through my notes and make Anki cards. 

This worked better than before. It didn't last. Although I stuck with it for a good few months, the approach still had many problems:

- It was too much work to create Anki cards, I usually spent an hour reading through and understanding a tutorial followed by half an hour making about 10 finely polished Anki cards
- My cards were often too basic, I found that when reading "introductory" notes on some topic, most of the cards I made were far too shallow and only covered the cosmetic details

## This time will be different

I'm determined to get Anki to work for me. I have read many good things about it and I believe it could be great if only I could start using it better. 

I recently found [this article by someone who has created 10,000 Anki cards](http://rs.io/2014/04/05/Anki-10000-cards-later.html). I recommend reading it but here is the advice I took from it:

- "Why" questions are more important than memorising facts. This feels obvious yet all my previous efforts had been focused on creating factual cards. I think that "why" questions are much more open ended than factual questions, they give the opportunity for your mind to explore the question and consider other things that may be linked to it. With a factual question, it can be too easy to simply regurgitate the answer without understanding it. I also think that "why" questions offer a better ratio of knowledge remembered to cards created. Hopefully that should help reduce the administrative effort of creating and organising cards. 

- Don't just create one-way connections. Sometimes you need to remember something when given different prompts. For example, you could be reading a bash script written by someone else and see `ls -r`. It's useful to know that that means reverse and *not recursive*. However, you may instead be writing a script yourself and need to list a directory in reverse order. You need to be able to remember which option you need. 

- There is no need to create multiple decks. Mixing questions from different topics can be beneficial. Additionally, I noticed before that I often had only one or two cards to study in each deck and it was a pain to have to keep switching decks. 

## Some specific guidelines for myself

Specifically, here is what I plan to do:

- Make an Anki card whenever I learn something [worth remembering](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#how-much-to-add)
- Avoid creating too many purely factual cards or cards with little value
- Review daily and [whenever it is most convenient for myself](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#when-to-review)
- Use a single massive deck and sync it with my Android phone

I will create another post in a month or so with my progress.
