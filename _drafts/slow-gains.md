title: "100 push ups: the ultimate slow gains experiment"
---

I have recently written about the [growth mindset](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/). When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities can be improved with hard work and practice. 

There are many things in my life I want to improve. However, I'm going to start with exercise. I've previously tried and failed to form exercise habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time I want it to be different. This time I'm going to make it **so easy I can't fail**.


## The plan

There are plenty of exercise plans out there. Far too many in fact. I've tried the [one hundred push ups training program](http://hundredpushups.com/) before but never stuck to it. I could write a whole article on why new habits fail. Right now, I'm just going to focus on what I want to do this time. I want to form the habit of doing push ups. I want it to be *simple*, *easy* and *repeatable daily*. 

My plan is to do *exactly two push ups* every single morning this week. Next week, I will do *exactly four push ups* every single morning. The week after, *exactly six push ups* every single morning. 

And so on. In just under a year, I will be doing 100 push ups a day (hence the title). 

## So easy I can't fail

I can currently do *seven* good-form push ups before collapsing from exhaustion. In some ways, doing just two per day in the first week feels *too easy*. I already know that it's not going to be at all challenging. However, that's the point. It's *supposed to be easy*. 

The second week will be slightly harder but still well within my limits. 

TODO add links to zenhabits and james clear, also mention rest days and sets

I've eventually given up all of my previous attempts to form exercise habits. I hope that by starting small and simple, I will be able to keep going
