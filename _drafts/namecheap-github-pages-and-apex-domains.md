title: Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains
---

When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that [GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network](https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages). But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. [davidxmoody.com](http://davidxmoody.com/) instead of [www.davidxmoody.com](http://www.davidxmoody.com/)).


Well, it doesn't work with apex domains on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (which I had already registered with). But it does work on other services like [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/). This really annoyed me. 

As I saw it, there were three possibilities:

1. Use a "www" subdomain
2. Switch to DNSimple
3. Don't take advantage of GitHub's CDN

I really wanted to stick with [davidxmoody.com](http://davidxmoody.com/) instead of [www.davidxmoody.com](http://www.davidxmoody.com/). Mostly for aesthetic reasons. It is of course *technically feasible* to change your user-facing domain name later on. It's still a bad idea though.
