title: A new project

I've been wanting something new to work on since I finished setting up this blog. I've decided to start work on a new game. I'm going to stick with the tools I'm already familiar with (AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Gulp, Sass, etc.). I don't want to aim too big. This is still going to be a relatively small static browser based game.
