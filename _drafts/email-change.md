title: Changing my email address
---

I have a *new email address*. It is now <david@davidxmoody.com>. 


I had been running this blog for two and a half months but was still using my old Gmail address. Now that I'm thinking of applying for jobs, I want something that looks a bit more *professional*. I think my new email address makes it pretty obvious that I have my own personal domain. I'm hoping that people will see it and think *"I guess that guy must know what he's doing"*. 

Actually setting it up was pretty easy. I've already registered the [davidxmoody.com](http://davidxmoody.com/) domain with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). They also offer an email service for only Â£6.12 per year.

I briefly considered using [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/work/apps/business/) but was turned off by the pricing ($50 per year). I also didn't want to duplicate all the features of my regular Google account. 

There was only one slight problem remaining. I had [about 800 commits on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/davidxmoody) with my old Gmail address. I could have left them as they were (GitHub allows you to associate more than one email address with your account). However, I didn't think anyone else had cloned them yet and I wanted to have some degree of *consistency* across all of my public commits. 

Thankfully, GitHub provide instructions on how to [change author info in published repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/). Their instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly.
