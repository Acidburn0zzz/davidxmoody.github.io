TODO link to what is croquet, mention golf/AC


## Early introduction to the game

My Dad first introduced me to the game when I was about TODO years old. I started playing in our garden with a very basic wooden mallet. I enjoyed it a lot. However, at the time, it wasn't any more special to me than the other games we played as a family (putting, bowls, countless board games and so on).

## Abbey Croquet Club

In TODO, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad went along and encouraged me to go. I enjoyed it and was persuaded to play in two matches. The first was at home, I won TODO of my games and was very pleased. Unfortunately, the second match was away (at Wells) and I lost TODO of my matches. 

I think that second match really shattered my confidence. I stopped playing croquet for quite a while. I didn't play at Cambridge even though I could have. 

## Abbey Croquet Club again

When I graduated from university and came back home, I re-joined the club. It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). The lawn was much better, if not perfect. I played with my Dad and his friends for a while. 

I then entered an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at that point and came in second place. That boosted my confidence a whole lot. I decided to buy my own mallet that year.

## First year of matches

In 2012, I played in my first few golf croquet matches. I was very nervous about my first match. Thankfully, my Dad and I won our first two doubles games together which put me in good spirits. I then proceeded to win one and lose one game on my own. I felt like I had played well so I was content. 

I should also mention that I started off playing with a handicap of 6 (minimum is 0 and maximum is 12). In the matches we were playing, the higher handicapped player gets a number of "free shots" equal to the difference in handicaps. It's a relatively fair way of balancing games.

I played in 4 matches that year. Out of my 12 singles games, I won 8, lost 2 and drew 2. I was very pleased with that. I was also improving constantly through all the practice. 

## Second year of matches

My second year was pretty similar to the first. I played well. Our team also practised constantly together and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the semi-final and then the final. We won the league for the first time ever.

In that year, I won 21, lost 11 and drew 4. My handicap dropped to a 4.

TODO what is AC

That year, I had also started playing association croquet (a different variation to the golf croquet I had been playing before). I started playing in matches half way through the season. We did incredibly well in that too, also winning the final.

## Third year of matches

After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone up considerably. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I was the best golf croquet player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone else I was playing. 

Additionally there was a new rule that year. It stated that a 3 handicap had to play off an effective handicap of 2 and a 2 had to play off a 0. That meant I was giving away one or two more free shots than normal and I was still doing very well. 

Won 24, lost 5, drew 0

We won not only the golf croquet final but also the association croquet final.

## Future plans

Unfortunately, the croquet season has now ended. We still play on weekends but it's too cold and dark to play in evenings. I am also planning to move away from home before the beginning of next year. So things must change. 

Next year, I plan to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I'm also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still want to play in some matches for Abbey but I also want to join a new club too.
