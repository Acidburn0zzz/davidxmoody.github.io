TODO link to what is croquet, mention golf/AC


## Early introduction to the game

My Dad first introduced me to the game when I was about TODO years old. I started off playing in our garden with a very basic wooden mallet. I liked the game but didn't feel any special attraction to it at the time. We probably played more putting than croquet. 

## Abbey Croquet Club

In TODO, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad went along and encouraged me to go. I went and quite enjoyed it. I played in two matches. The first was at home, I won TODO of my games. That got me pretty excited and I was eager to play again. Unfortunately, in my second match, I lost TODO of my games. 

That shattered my confidence. I went off croquet for many years. I didn't play at Cambridge even though I could have. 

## Abbey Croquet Club again

When I graduated from university and came back home, I re-joined the club. It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). The lawn was much better but still far from perfect. I played with my Dad and his friends for a while. 

I then entered an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at that point and came in second place. That boosted my confidence and I bought my own mallet. 

## First year of matches

In 2012, I played in my first few golf croquet matches. I was very nervous about my first match. Thankfully, the convention is to play two doubles games before any singles games are played. I won both of the first two games with my Dad which was a nice introduction. I then lost one and won one of my singles games. I felt like I had played well so I was content. 

My other matches all continued in a similar fashion. I was consistently winning slightly more than I was losing. I was also getting better with all the practice. 

## Second year of matches

My second year was pretty similar to the first. I played well. Our team also practised constantly together and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the semi-final and then the final. We won the league for the first time ever. 

That year, I had also started playing association croquet (a different variation to the golf croquet I had been playing before). I started playing in matches half way through the season. We did incredibly well in that too, also winning the final. 

## Third year of matches

After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone way up. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I was the best player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone else I was playing. 

TODO mention new zero HC rule

We won not only the golf croquet final but also the association croquet final. 

## Future plans

Unfortunately, the croquet season has now ended. It's too cold and it gets too dark on evenings. I also plan to move away from home before the beginning of next year. So things must change. 

Next year, I plan to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I'm also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still want to play in some matches for Abbey but I also want to join a new club too.
