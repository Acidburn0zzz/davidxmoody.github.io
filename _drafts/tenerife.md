title: My 10 best Tenerife photos
---

In March of this year, I went on a family holiday with my parents to Tenerife. It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. 

That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. We took literally 3000 photos in total. About 700 worth keeping after they had been edited down. 

I wanted to share my favourites. I've probably got about 50 very good ones but that's too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.
