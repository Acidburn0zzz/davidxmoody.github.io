          <h1>One month of blogging</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 5, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#39;s
          about 7,000 words. </p>
        <p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely
          ready but I also knew it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I&#39;ve been blogging
          for one month, it&#39;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what
          went well and what could have gone better. </p>

          <p><em>Sep 3, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>This post will introduce a handy little Bash tip. I created it over a year
          ago but many other people have already done similar things.</p>
        <p>Bash aliases are incredibly convenient. If, for some reason, you don&#39;t
          already use them then you should <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions">read this tutorial</a>.

          <p><em>Sep 1, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces
          the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the
          right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>

          <h1>Vim auto-capitalisation</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 29, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Continuing in the same theme as my <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">last post</a>,
          I am going to write about another awesome Vim tip I found recently. That
          is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
        <p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other
          text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why.
          I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys.
          It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

          <h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written
          <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
        <p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common
          typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5
          key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced
          that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only
          two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress
          on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

          <h1>My password generation scheme</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 25, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows
          95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>.
          I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior)
          <code>654321</code>. </p>
        <p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name.
          When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply
          added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>
