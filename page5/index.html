          <h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written
          <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
        <p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common
          typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5
          key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced
          that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only
          two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress
          on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

          <h1>My password generation scheme</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 25, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows
          95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>.
          I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior)
          <code>654321</code>. </p>
        <p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name.
          When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply
          added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

          <p><em>Aug 22, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago.
          Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>.
          It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
        <p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made
          me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully.

          <p><em>Aug 20, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>.
          But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="http://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a>          instead of <a href="http://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>

          <h1>Wordsearch game</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 18, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>For my first post not about blogging, I thought I would return to my wordsearch
          game. I made it for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/">professorp.co.uk</a>          website and I would say it&#39;s the game I&#39;m proudest of. I really
          like the simplicity and style of it. </p>
        <p>In this post, I will take a look back at what I&#39;ve already done and
          make a note of what I think could be improved. In subsequent posts, I
          plan to make some improvements and also make it into a standalone game.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>.
          There is one thing I particularly like about their RSS feed. It shows
          the first few paragraphs of the article followed by a link saying &quot;Read
          X remaining paragraphs&quot;. </p>
        <p>If I can&#39;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next
          best option. It has two big advantages: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to
            read the whole thing</li>
          <li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>
        </ul>
