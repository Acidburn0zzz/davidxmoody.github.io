          <h1>Music for programming</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 1, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces
          the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the
          right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>

          <h1>Vim auto-capitalisation</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 29, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>Continuing in the same theme as my <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">last post</a>,
          I am going to write about another awesome Vim tip I found recently. That
          is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
        <p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other
          text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why.
          I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys.
          It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

          <h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written
          <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
        <p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common
          typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5
          key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced
          that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only
          two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress
          on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

          <p><em>Aug 25, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows
          95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>.
          I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior)
          <code>654321</code>. </p>
        <p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name.
          When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply
          added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

          <p><em>Aug 22, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago.
          Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>.
          It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
        <p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made
          me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully.

          <p><em>Aug 20, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>.
          But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="http://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a>          instead of <a href="http://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>
