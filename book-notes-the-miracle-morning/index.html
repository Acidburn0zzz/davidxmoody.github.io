      <article><header><h1>Book notes: The Miracle Morning</h1><p><em>Jun 5, 2016</em></p></header><div><p>Last week I tried out a new service called <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/">Blinkist</a>. They provide 15 minute summaries of non-fiction books. My initial experience has been amazing and I have now subscribed to them.</p>
<p>I have also been writing notes on paper of all the summaries I&#39;ve been reading. The first book I read was <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/the-miracle-morning-en.html">The Miracle Morning</a> by Hal Elrod.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I was interested in this book because I have recently been experimenting with my morning routine. I&#39;ve already made some massive changes and I am always curious to know what else I can do. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to attempt to give a full summary in these blog posts. Rather, I want to focus on the key points that I found most significant to my life. Thus I will probably be skipping over a lot of stuff which may be useful to other people but which I have already internalised.</p>
<h2 id="key-steps-to-a-successful-morning-routine">Key steps to a successful morning routine</h2>
<h3 id="1-silence-aka-meditation-or-mindfulness-">1. Silence (aka meditation or mindfulness)</h3>
<p>Silence seems very important to me. One thing that used to be a problem with my morning routine was that I kept using my phone too much immediately after waking up. </p>
<p>I now keep my phone outside of my bedroom and never use it until I have already finished every other step in my morning routine. I feel like this helps me to be more mindful.</p>
<p>However, I have never yet been able to stick to a real meditation habit, despite multiple attempts in the past. I recently tried <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> in another attempt but just kept forgetting to use the app. </p>
<p>I do drink tea nearly every morning and remember several other people talking about meditating while drinking tea/letting it brew. That is something I&#39;d like to explore.</p>
<h3 id="2-affirmations">2. Affirmations</h3>
<p>This is something I&#39;ve never actually tried even once. I&#39;ve read Scott Adams and a few other people write about how good it can be. It is my lowest priority although I may try it at some point.</p>
<h3 id="3-visualisations">3. Visualisations</h3>
<p>Again, this is something I&#39;ve really never tried before. I also disagree with the summary somewhat. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For example, if you want to write a book, visualize yourself feeling inspired and joyfully writing page after page at your desk.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels like completely the wrong approach in my opinion. I don&#39;t remember where I first heard this but I remember several sources saying that purely positive visualisations are not an effective method for accomplishing goals. </p>
<p>What can be effective is to visualise realistic situations and imagine how you might deal with them and overcome any problems that may arise.</p>
<p>Then there is also the concept of negative visualisations from stoicism (which I read another Blinkist summary on recently and will write about later). </p>
<p>I see the value in visualisations but am not sure how to work them into my morning routine yet. </p>
<h3 id="4-exercise">4. Exercise</h3>
<p>Exercise is something that I have been managing very successfully recently. </p>
<p>I took up running one mile every morning this March. I&#39;ve been incredibly pleased with the habit. I chose to focus on consistency rather than any other metrics like time or distance. Over the last 74 days, I have run one mile on 53 of those days. <strong>That&#39;s 72%!</strong> Additionally, a lot of those missed days were either due to minor injury or heavy rain so the number I missed out of laziness has been very small. </p>
<p>I also started doing push ups every morning four weeks ago. Again, I&#39;m choosing to focus on consistency. Over the last 28 days, I have only skipped 6 days due to laziness or extreme soreness. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been tracking the number I can do each time. I started off at about 10-12 and am now able to do about 15-17. I admit that I often get a little impatient that I haven&#39;t been improving faster but then I catch myself with that line of thinking and realise it&#39;s not helpful. I also realise that since I am doing them every day, I am always a little bit sore from the previous day so my absolute maximum could be higher.</p>
<p>Although I am very pleased with my running and push ups habits, they are still new enough that I&#39;m wary of pushing myself too hard and burning out. I plan to continue my exercise habits for 1-3 months longer before reviewing them.</p>
<h3 id="5-reading">5. Reading</h3>
<p>Reading is very important to me. However, I am a very slow reader. I like to take my time and think about everything in detail before moving on. </p>
<p>There is one particular book that I started over a month ago but still haven&#39;t finished because every time I pick it up I read just one chapter and then spend the next half hour thinking about what I just read. (The book I&#39;m talking about is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Turn-Ship-Around-Building-ebook/dp/B015QQ10HE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Turn The Ship Around!</a> by David Marquet but I&#39;ll write about that some other time.)</p>
<p>If anything, subscribing to Blinkist has made me realise the flaws in that approach. I definitely see the benefit in reading more quickly. I remember reading somewhere the idea that &quot;once you read a book on some topic and think to yourself that you&#39;ve read it all before then you are starting to master that topic&quot;. I feel that reading books more quickly (or reading Blinkist summaries) will help me to reach that point more quickly.</p>
<p>Initially after reading this summary, I had the awesome idea to read one Blinkist summary every single morning and write notes on them. The next morning, I did that and it was amazing. The morning after that, I did it again and it was pretty good. The morning after that I just did not have the energy and have not done it again since. I&#39;ve been reading in the evenings instead. </p>
<p>I think the problem was that I chose book summaries that were just too long and detailed. The first summary I read in the morning took me 1 hour 15 minutes to read and write three pages of notes on. The second one was nearly as long. That&#39;s just a bit much to ask every single morning.</p>
<p>I think in the future, I should simply aim to do <em>some amount of reading/note taking</em> rather than aiming to complete an entire book. Making notes on an entire summary is just too hard to reliably complete every single morning. The harder a task is, the more motivation is required to start it and the less likely it is to become a habit.</p>
<h3 id="6-writing">6. Writing</h3>
<p>I kind of already covered this one in the &quot;note taking&quot; while reading summaries above. Additionally, writing blog posts is another good form of writing. I also frequently write in my diary (although not usually in the mornings). </p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This post has turned into more of a discussion of my own habits rather than a review of the book summary. That&#39;s fine although I expect future summaries to follow the books more closely. </p>
<p>I&#39;m glad I read this one first. It was an easy first read and got me in the mood for wanting to change my habits. I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s an accident that this book is promoted so heavily on Blinkist. I&#39;m pretty sure they are doing it deliberately to get people excited about changing their habits and be more likely to commit to subscribing for a year. It certainly worked on me.</p>
