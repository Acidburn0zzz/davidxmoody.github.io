## Post ideas

- Standalone wordsearch game (CSS/server)
- Lessons learned from building the Professor P site
- Contribute to external GitHub repos (Metalsmith plugins?)
- Make and publish a Vim auto-capitalisation plugin
- Learn Git better (read the book in full and make notes)
- Go through Vim plugins top list
- Write about Vifm
- Switch from Terminator to tmux (also customise inputrc)
- Add Git branch to Bash prompt
- "Primal success story" (with photos)
- Shorthand abbreviations/EasyScript system

"Idea for a static site generator that I will never implement", go over the idea for my purely React based SSG which progressively enhances images and transitions between pages and generates an endpoint for each terminal page but uses push state for faster page transitions and also incrementally updates only the pages necessary using internal DOM writing to files not the real DOM. Reason for not implementing it is that it is overkill for a static site. It is too much work for simple page transitions. Tries to re-implement what the browser does. Too much complexity. Only writing about it to try and get it out of my head. 

Different ways to embed static apps into static websites. For example my old Professor P way of doing it then the render server and client side methods and finally my new idea: provide the module exports as being one main executable function, it accepts options and outputs it's own html, scripts, styles and a list of files with paths. Allows for greater flexibility within each module but less reuse also allows for publishing directly to npm so you can have a prepublish step. 

Create an NPM repo for pagination logic

Idea: Use recurrent neural networks to process bank charge statements 

## Blog tweaks

- Add index page description
- Add about-me page
- Change background colour of code elements
- Reduce text size on mobile devices (and in general?)
- Favicon (http://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Tags
- Change email on home page to use obfuscated email (or use separate contacts page)
- Separate watch script for drafts
- Custom 404 page, make it do JavaScript redirects to other pages when I specify a redirect slug in a post

Full Material UI redesign:
