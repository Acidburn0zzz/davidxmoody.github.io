# Post ideas

## Tools

- FZF (my `p` script)
- Ranger
- `sed -i`
- New git bash prompt with commits ahead/behind
- Try <https://github.com/feross/standard> as an alternative to eslint
- Try Vim Easymotion
- Finish reading about Material UI
- Ramda command line tool
- Try <https://libraries.io/npm/super-react>

## My experience

- From ES5 to CoffeeScript and back to ES6 again
- Ideas about static site generators which build an observable dependency map and only re-build what they need to (similar to mobx)
- Growth mindset part 3
- Update wordsearch game post with iframe?
- YourWealth retrospective (mortgages, life insurance, decision tree)

# Blog tweaks

- Add comments (Discourse)
- Add about-me page
- Change background colour of code elements and increase width
- Reduce text size on mobile devices
- Favicon <http://realfavicongenerator.net/>
- Tag explorer page or better archive page
- Change email on home page to use obfuscated email (or put it somewhere else)
- Custom 404 page, make it do JavaScript redirects to other pages when I specify a redirect slug in a post's metadata
- Better header with more links to important pages (do NOT use a hamburger menu)
- Asynchronous "load more" button for pagination
- Flowcharts on my blog? <https://github.com/adrai/flowchart.js>
