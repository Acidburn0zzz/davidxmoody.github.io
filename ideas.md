## Post ideas

- Write about ideas/implementation of standalone wordsearch game
- Lessons learned from building the Professor P website
- Contribute to external GitHub repos
- Write about how I feel about my repos getting GitHub issues or stars
- Make and publish a Vim auto-capitalisation plugin
- Vim plugin for 
- Git branching strategies and rebasing
- Go through Vim plugins top list
- Switch from Terminator to tmux (also customise inputrc)
- Add Git branch to Bash prompt, also maybe whether or not the current branch has been pushed to origin
- About me: "Primal success story" (with photos)
- Git commit hook to make sure your commit messages are in imperative mood

Quick post ideas: 

- Tip to use beautify with zero indent and infinite line length as an alternative to html minification
- Using react templates for rendering to static markup, pros and cons

Write growth mindset post part 3.

Update "Big list of blogs I like" post.

"Idea for a static site generator that I will never implement", go over the idea for my purely React based SSG which progressively enhances images and transitions between pages and generates an endpoint for each terminal page but uses push state for faster page transitions and also incrementally updates only the pages necessary using internal DOM writing to files not the real DOM. Reason for not implementing it is that it is overkill for a static site. It is too much work for simple page transitions. Tries to re-implement what the browser does. Too much complexity. Only writing about it to try and get it out of my head. 

Different ways to embed static apps into static websites. For example my old Professor P way of doing it then the render server and client side methods and finally my new idea: provide the module exports as being one main executable function, it accepts options and outputs it's own html, scripts, styles and a list of files with paths. Allows for greater flexibility within each module but less reuse also allows for publishing directly to npm so you can have a prepublish step. 

Idea: Use recurrent neural networks to process bank charge statements 

Idea: Use my metalsmith-broken-link-checker as a standalone static site checker (with a one step metalsmith build process).

## Blog tweaks

- Add comments (Disqus)
- Add about-me page
- Change background colour of code elements
- Reduce text size on mobile devices (and in general?)
- Favicon (http://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Tags (actually use them)
- Change email on home page to use obfuscated email (or use separate contacts page)
- Custom 404 page, make it do JavaScript redirects to other pages when I specify a redirect slug in a post

Full Material UI redesign:

- Better buttons
- Better header with more links to important pages
