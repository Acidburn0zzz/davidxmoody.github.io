        <p>I am now a firm believer in the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When someone
          has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence,
          talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice.
          This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are
          &quot;fixed&quot; and cannot be improved upon. </p>
        <p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I&#39;m trying to change
          that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the
          different mindsets have impacted me. </p>
        <h2 id="my-academic-life">My academic life</h2>
        <p>I had a fixed mindset from early on in life. I always used to think of myself
          as an &quot;intelligent person&quot;. In primary and secondary school,
          I thought of myself as a person who was good at maths and science and
          bad at English and art. My grades reflected that and I never improved
          in the subjects I thought I was bad at. </p>
        <p>In college, I took only maths and science subjects. I did well. Very well.
          I was usually among the top of the class. In my second year, I chose to
          continue all five of my subjects. I was the only person to do so, with
          everyone else dropping to three or four. My final A-level results were
          very good. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maths: <strong>95.8%</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Further Maths: <strong>95.8%</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Physics: <strong>95.3%</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Chemistry: <strong>95.5%</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Biology: <strong>82.8%</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was very pleased at the time. I&#39;m now starting to realise that it
          may have done me more harm than good. </p>
        <p>You see, I had an incredibly good work environment at college. I talked
          constantly about the work with friends, both in classes and outside. The
          teachers and physical environment were also excellent. </p>
        <p>However, I simply &quot;found&quot; myself in this great environment. I
          took advantage of it without really realising what was going on. I thought
          I was doing well because I was smart. Now, I realise it was because of
          my environment. </p>
        <h2 id="university">University</h2>
        <p>I got accepted into Cambridge to study Natural Sciences. I found the lectures
          to be completely different to the classes at college. Instead of actively
          participating, I just sat there getting bored. I was often too tired to
          really listen and ended up skipping a lot of lectures. </p>
        <p>Cambridge&#39;s supervisions really saved me. I had to do a significant
          amount of work for each (3-8 hours, four times a week). We then got to
          talk about it for an hour (with two or three students per supervisor).
          I worked hard out of a desire to please my supervisors. </p>
        <p>Again, I simply accepted my environment without trying to influence it.
          Still, it wasn&#39;t that bad. The supervisions and hard work &quot;forced&quot;
          me to learn. I scored about average in my first year exams. </p>
        <p>In my second year, I switched to Computer Science. My behaviour continued.
          I labelled myself as a &quot;software person&quot;, not a &quot;hardware
          person&quot;. Subsequently, I failed to improve at all in any of my hardware-related
          subjects. I could have done much better if I had had a growth mindset.
          </p>
        <p>The same story continued throughout my third year. I got a 2:1 in the final
          exams, scoring only slightly above the median. I had worked hard in my
          supervisions and had been predicted to get a first. That made me complacent,
          I thought I was &quot;smart enough&quot; to succeed with little further
          effort. I procrastinated and <em>literally</em> did not start revising
          until two weeks before the exams. </p>
