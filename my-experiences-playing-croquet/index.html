<p>I haven&#39;t written about it before but I am a very keen croquet player. I thought I would share some of my experiences playing in matches over the last few years. </p>

<h2 id="early-introduction-to-the-game">Early introduction to the game</h2>
<p>My Dad first introduced me to croquet when I was about 15 years old. I started playing in my grandparents&#39; garden with a very basic wooden mallet. </p>
<p><img src="/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/croquet-in-garden.jpg" alt="Croquet in my grandparents&#39; garden"></p>
<h2 id="abbey-croquet-club">Abbey Croquet Club</h2>
<p>Around 2005, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad went along and encouraged me to go. I enjoyed it and was persuaded to play in two matches. The first went very well but the second went very badly. I stopped playing for a while after that. I didn&#39;t play at Cambridge even though I could have. </p>
<h2 id="abbey-croquet-club-again">Abbey Croquet Club again</h2>
<p>After university, I re-joined the club. It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). I played with my Dad and his friends for a while. </p>
<p>We then had an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at that point and came in second place. That really boosted my confidence. I bought my own mallet that year.</p>
<h2 id="first-year-of-matches">First year of matches</h2>
<p>In 2012, I started playing in matches again. I was very nervous. Thankfully, my first few matches went well and everyone was very friendly.</p>
<p>I started off playing with a handicap of 6 (minimum is 0 and maximum is 12). In the matches we were playing, the higher handicapped player gets a number of &quot;free shots&quot; equal to the difference in handicaps. It&#39;s a relatively fair way of balancing games.</p>
<p>I played in 4 matches that year. Out of my 12 singles games, I won 8, lost 2 and drew 2. I was improving steadily because of all the practice. </p>
<h2 id="second-year-of-matches">Second year of matches</h2>
<p>My second year of matches went very well. Our team practised together <em>constantly</em> and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the semi-final and then the final. We won the South West Handicap League for the first time ever. In that year, I won 21, lost 11 and drew 4. My handicap dropped to a 4.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="association-croquet">Association croquet</h2>
<p>I should mention that all references to &quot;croquet&quot; so far have referring to &quot;golf croquet&quot;. There is another variation on the game called &quot;association croquet&quot;. I started playing association croquet that year. My Dad had taught me the basics a while ago and my golf croquet skills transferred across nicely. </p>
<p>I started playing in matches about half way through the season. I was nervous at the beginning but picked it up very quickly. That year, we won the South West Intermediate League for the first time ever.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="third-year-of-matches">Third year of matches</h2>
<p>After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone up considerably. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an exaggeration to say I was the best golf croquet player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone else I was playing. </p>
<p>Additionally, there was a new rule that year. It meant that lower handicap players (like myself) had to give away even more free shots than normal. Despite the additional difficulty, I had my best season yet. I won 24 games and only lost 5. I also dropped to a 2 handicap.</p>
<p>Our whole team frequently practised together and we improved even more. We also got a new team member. For the second year in a row, we won the South West Handicap League.</p>

</p>
<p>Our association croquet team also continued to improve. That year, we won the South West Federation League. </p>

</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the croquet season has ended. We still play on weekends but it&#39;s too cold and dark to play in the evenings. I am also planning to move away from Glastonbury soon so things must change. </p>
<p>Next year, I hope to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I&#39;m also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still want to play in matches for Abbey but I am also planning to join a new club.</p>
<p>I plan to keep playing croquet for a long time to come. It&#39;s a great game. </p>
