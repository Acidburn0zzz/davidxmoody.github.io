<p>Although I have released everything I&#39;ve ever made on <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub</a>, I had never created anything which other people could <em>actually use</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to change that. This is the story of how I published my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-broken-link-checker">first npm package</a> and what I learned along the way.</p>

I think one of the best ways to improve is to utilise <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/better-vim-abbreviations/">abbreviations</a> and other <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/vim-auto-capitalisation/">tricks</a>. </p>
<p>I recently looked into a shorthand system called <a href="http://www.easyscript.com/">EasyScript</a>. The most important part I took from it is to develop a set of short abbreviations for the most common words. They give a set of suggested abbreviations but I wasn&#39;t happy with them. Instead, I wanted to analyse my own writing to find my most commonly used words and phrases. </p>

I&#39;m glad I started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I knew (JavaScript). </p>
<p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a> for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website). I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal restrictions. </p>
<p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty. Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

However, I noticed this blog was still taking longer than expected to load. </p>
<p>I discovered <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2014/04/transferring-the-dns-from-namecheap-to-cloudflare-for-github-pages/">this post by David Ensinger</a> in which he describes the same problem. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his other posts and we appear to have pretty similar setups. The problem he describes is a time consuming 302 redirect caused by using GitHub Pages with a DNS <code>A</code> record. I suggest you look at his post for more details. </p>

It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it also has some limitations.</p>
<p>For example, although Jekyll &quot;supports&quot; tags, you can&#39;t create pages to list all posts with a given tag. At least not without using a plugin, which GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t allow.</p>
<p>There is an easy way around this. You can build the site locally (using any plugins or code you want) and still host it on GitHub Pages. It&#39;s pretty simple although there are a few caveats. </p>

I really enjoyed it. I learned from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>
<p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>

<p>That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I&#39;ve probably got about 50 very good ones but that&#39;s too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.</p>
