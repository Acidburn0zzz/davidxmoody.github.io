<p>The previous three book summaries I read were packed full of specific tips. The next few are all a bit shorter and deal with more abstract concepts rather than actionable bullet points. </p>

<p>I first started programming JavaScript with vanilla ES5. I disliked it right from the start having grown accustomed to the nice syntax of Python and ended up switching to CoffeeScript for quite a while. However, around June of last year, I got interested in ES6/ES2015 again.</p>
<p>These are some of my notes from reading <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/">this book</a> on ES6 features. I deliberately didn&#39;t write about anything I already found trivial, deciding to only focus on things I didn&#39;t already know. I never got to the end of the book but still decided to publish it.</p>

<p>I recently looked into a shorthand system called <a href="http://www.easyscript.com/">EasyScript</a>. The most important part I took from it is to develop a set of short abbreviations for the most common words. They give a set of suggested abbreviations but I wasn&#39;t happy with them. Instead, I wanted to analyse my own writing to find my most commonly used words and phrases. </p>

I&#39;m glad I started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I knew (JavaScript). </p>
<p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a> for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website). I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal restrictions. </p>
<p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty. Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

<p>I discovered <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2014/04/transferring-the-dns-from-namecheap-to-cloudflare-for-github-pages/">this post by David Ensinger</a> in which he describes the same problem. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his other posts and we appear to have pretty similar setups. The problem he describes is a time consuming 302 redirect caused by using GitHub Pages with a DNS <code>A</code> record. I suggest you look at his post for more details. </p>

It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it also has some limitations.</p>
<p>For example, although Jekyll &quot;supports&quot; tags, you can&#39;t create pages to list all posts with a given tag. At least not without using a plugin, which GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t allow.</p>
<p>There is an easy way around this. You can build the site locally (using any plugins or code you want) and still host it on GitHub Pages. It&#39;s pretty simple although there are a few caveats. </p>

I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had. Of course, writing fast is only a very small part of being a good writer. Nevertheless, these small gains add up. The less time I spend writing, the more time I can spend thinking.</p>

<p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>

When someone has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence, talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice. This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are &quot;fixed&quot; and cannot be improved upon. </p>
<p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I&#39;m trying to change that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the different mindsets have impacted me. </p>

I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
<p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised this sooner. </p>

That is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
<p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why. I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys. It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

Way back in the days of Windows 95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>. I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior) <code>654321</code>. </p>
<p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

<p>If I can&#39;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next best option. It has two big advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to read the whole thing</li>
<li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>

I may someday post articles about what I&#39;ve already done (or upload it to my <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub profile</a>).

It is a website for the Professor P series of children&#39;s books and also includes <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">five JavaScript games</a>. </p>
