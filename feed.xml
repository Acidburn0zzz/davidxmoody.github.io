It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. For the first three months of this blog, I used Jekyll and GitHub Pages and was very happy with it. </p>

Jekyll has been good to me for the last three months. However, I found myself wanting more control. I also wanted to be able to write extensions in JavaScript rather than Ruby. </p>
<p>This blog is now completely built by <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith">Metalsmith</a>. It&#39;s a very simple static site generator. It&#39;s really just a way to help manipulate directories of files. All the interesting stuff is done by plugins, of which there are plenty.</p>

I really enjoyed it. I learned from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>
<p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>

It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. </p>
<p>That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I&#39;ve probably got about 50 very good ones but that&#39;s too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.</p>

Both to prove I&#39;ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.</p>
<p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold &#39;em poker-bot</strong> which uses the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.</p>
