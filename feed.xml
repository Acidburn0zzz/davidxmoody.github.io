I think one of the best ways to improve is to utilise <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/better-vim-abbreviations/">abbreviations</a> and other <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/vim-auto-capitalisation/">tricks</a>. </p>
<p>I recently looked into a shorthand system called <a href="http://www.easyscript.com/">EasyScript</a>. The most important part I took from it is to develop a set of short abbreviations for the most common words. They give a set of suggested abbreviations but I wasn&#39;t happy with them. Instead, I wanted to analyse my own writing to find my most commonly used words and phrases. </p>

I&#39;m glad I started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I knew (JavaScript). </p>
<p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a> for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website). I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal restrictions. </p>
<p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty. Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

However, I noticed this blog was still taking longer than expected to load. </p>
<p>I discovered <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2014/04/transferring-the-dns-from-namecheap-to-cloudflare-for-github-pages/">this post by David Ensinger</a> in which he describes the same problem. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his other posts and we appear to have pretty similar setups. The problem he describes is a time consuming 302 redirect caused by using GitHub Pages with a DNS <code>A</code> record. I suggest you look at his post for more details. </p>

It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it also has some limitations.</p>
<p>For example, although Jekyll &quot;supports&quot; tags, you can&#39;t create pages to list all posts with a given tag. At least not without using a plugin, which GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t allow.</p>
<p>There is an easy way around this. You can build the site locally (using any plugins or code you want) and still host it on GitHub Pages. It&#39;s pretty simple although there are a few caveats. </p>

That is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
<p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why. I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys. It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

Way back in the days of Windows 95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>. I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior) <code>654321</code>. </p>
<p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>. It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
<p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. </p>

I made it for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/">professorp.co.uk</a> website and I would say it&#39;s the game I&#39;m proudest of. I really like the simplicity and style of it. </p>
<p>In this post, I will take a look back at what I&#39;ve already done and make a note of what I think could be improved. In subsequent posts, I plan to make some improvements and also make it into a standalone game.</p>

There is one thing I particularly like about their RSS feed. It shows the first few paragraphs of the article followed by a link saying &quot;Read X remaining paragraphs&quot;. </p>
<p>If I can&#39;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next best option. It has two big advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to read the whole thing</li>
<li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I&#39;m not an artist. I&#39;ve struggled with creating visually attractive content in the past. For my last project, <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>, I opted to use the default Bootstrap theme. I just wanted to get something up and running quickly.</p>

<p>I want to contribute something back to the world. I&#39;ve learned a lot over the past few years and I want to start sharing it. I may someday post articles about what I&#39;ve already done (or upload it to my <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub profile</a>). For now though, I am going to write about what I&#39;ve been interested in most recently: <strong>front end web development</strong>. </p>
<p>You can check out <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> to see my last project (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk">GitHub repo here</a>). It is a website for the Professor P series of children&#39;s books and also includes <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">five JavaScript games</a>. </p>
