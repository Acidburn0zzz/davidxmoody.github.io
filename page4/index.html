<h1>The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I&#x27;d known</h1>
<p><em>Sep 18, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
<p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised this sooner. </p>

<h1>One month of blogging</h1>
<p><em>Sep 5, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I have now published three posts per week for the last four weeks. That&#39;s about 7,000 words. </p>
<p>When I started, I just wanted to start. I knew I would never be completely ready but I also knew it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I&#39;ve been blogging for one month, it&#39;s time for a review. I want to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better. </p>

<h1>Permanent Bash aliases</h1>
<p><em>Sep 3, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>This post will introduce a handy little Bash tip. I created it over a year ago but many other people have already done similar things.</p>
<p>Bash aliases are incredibly convenient. If, for some reason, you don&#39;t already use them then you should <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions">read this tutorial</a>. </p>

<h1>Music for programming</h1>
<p><em>Sep 1, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>

<h1>Vim auto-capitalisation</h1>
<p><em>Aug 29, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Continuing in the same theme as my <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">last post</a>, I am going to write about another awesome Vim tip I found recently. That is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
<p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why. I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys. It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

<h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
<p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

<h1>My password generation scheme</h1>
<p><em>Aug 25, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows 95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>. I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior) <code>654321</code>. </p>
<p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

<h1>A third attempt at Anki</h1>
<p><em>Aug 22, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago. Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>. It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
<p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. </p>

<h1>Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains</h1>
<p><em>Aug 20, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p><em>[Edit: Since writing this post, I have switched to CloudFlare. Using their CNAME flattening, you can pretty much have it all: a fast CDN, an apex domain and no annoying 302 redirect that GitHub pages used to add. See <a href="/cloudflare-and-hashed-css/">this post</a> for details.]</em></p>
<p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>. But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a> instead of <a href="https://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>
