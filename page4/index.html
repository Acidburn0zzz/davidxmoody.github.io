<h1>Music for programming</h1>
<p><em>Sep 1, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Music is awesome. Music while programming is even more awesome. It reduces the effect of distracting background noise and helps you get into the right frame of mind. Without further ado, here are my recommendations.</p>

<h1>Vim auto-capitalisation</h1>
<p><em>Aug 29, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Continuing in the same theme as my <a href="/better-vim-abbreviations/">last post</a>, I am going to write about another awesome Vim tip I found recently. That is: automatic capitalisation of the first letter of each sentence. </p>
<p>Many word processors already include this. For some reason, Vim and other text editors don&#39;t usually have the option. I don&#39;t know why. I feel that a lot of unnecessary key-strokes are wasted on the shift keys. It also stresses the little fingers and twists the wrists.</p>

<h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
<p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
<p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5 key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>

<h1>My password generation scheme</h1>
<p><em>Aug 25, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve been using computers for a long time. Way back in the days of Windows 95 I had a tremendously insecure password. I think it was <code>1234</code>. I later upgraded to <code>123456</code> and then the (clearly far superior) <code>654321</code>. </p>
<p>At one point I used my mothers maiden name and later my cat&#39;s name. When I ran across sites that required numbers in the password, I simply added a <code>1</code> to the end.</p>

<h1>A third attempt at Anki</h1>
<p><em>Aug 22, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago. Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>. It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
<p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. </p>

<h1>Namecheap, GitHub Pages and apex domains</h1>
<p><em>Aug 20, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p><em>[Edit: Since writing this post, I have switched to CloudFlare. Using their CNAME flattening, you can pretty much have it all: a fast CDN, an apex domain and no annoying 302 redirect that GitHub pages used to add. See <a href="/cloudflare-and-hashed-css/">this post</a> for details.]</em></p>
<p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>. But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="https://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a> instead of <a href="https://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>

<h1>Wordsearch game</h1>
<p><em>Aug 18, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>For my first post not about blogging, I thought I would return to my wordsearch game. I made it for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/">professorp.co.uk</a> website and I would say it&#39;s the game I&#39;m proudest of. I really like the simplicity and style of it. </p>
<p>In this post, I will take a look back at what I&#39;ve already done and make a note of what I think could be improved. In subsequent posts, I plan to make some improvements and also make it into a standalone game.</p>

<h1>Paragraph counts in jekyll</h1>
<p><em>Aug 15, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>. There is one thing I particularly like about their RSS feed. It shows the first few paragraphs of the article followed by a link saying &quot;Read X remaining paragraphs&quot;. </p>
<p>If I can&#39;t read the full article from an RSS feed, this is the next best option. It has two big advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>It contains enough of the article to let you know if you will want to read the whole thing</li>
<li>It lets you know how long the entire article will be</li>
</ul>

<h1>Creating a style for this blog</h1>
<p><em>Aug 13, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I didn&#39;t want to use an existing template for this blog. As a web programmer/designer, it would feel wrong not to make my own. </p>
<p>However, I&#39;m not an artist. I&#39;ve struggled with creating visually attractive content in the past. For my last project, <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>, I opted to use the default Bootstrap theme. I just wanted to get something up and running quickly.</p>
<p>This post will describe some of the things I&#39;ve learned while creating this blog. </p>
