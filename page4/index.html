        <p>I don&#39;t have time to write a proper post right now so here is a big
          list of some of my favourite blogs. I use <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>          as my RSS reader and save longer articles to <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>          for later reading. </p>

          <h1>Writing speeds</h1>
          <p><em>Oct 2, 2014</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>I like to write a lot. I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For
          something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had.
          Of course, writing fast is only a very small part of being a good writer.
          Nevertheless, these small gains add up. The less time I spend writing,
          the more time I can spend thinking.</p>

          <h1>100 push ups: the ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 29, 2014</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>.
          When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities
          can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
        <p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going
          to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise
          habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time
          I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>

        <p>Continued from <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">part 1</a>.
          This part will discuss how the different mindsets affected me after I
          left university.</p>

        </header>

        <p>I am now a firm believer in the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When someone
          has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence,
          talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice.
          This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are
          &quot;fixed&quot; and cannot be improved upon. </p>
        <p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I&#39;m trying to change
          that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the
          different mindsets have impacted me. </p>

          <h1>The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I&#x27;d known</h1>
          <p><em>Sep 18, 2014</em></p>
        </header>

        <p>Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the
          Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but
          felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.</p>
        <p>However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My
          opinion has changed on what&#39;s truly important. I only wish I had realised
          this sooner. </p>
