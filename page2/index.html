<h1>Building a blog with Metalsmith</h1>
<p><em>Feb 11, 2015</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I recently transitioned this blog from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>. I&#39;m glad I started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I knew (JavaScript). </p>
<p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a> for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website). I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal restrictions. </p>
<p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty. Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

<h1>CloudFlare and hashed CSS</h1>
<p><em>Feb 2, 2015</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>One of the main advantages of static sites is supposed to be faster load times. However, I noticed this blog was still taking longer than expected to load. </p>
<p>I discovered <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2014/04/transferring-the-dns-from-namecheap-to-cloudflare-for-github-pages/">this post by David Ensinger</a> in which he describes the same problem. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his other posts and we appear to have pretty similar setups. The problem he describes is a time consuming 302 redirect caused by using GitHub Pages with a DNS <code>A</code> record. I suggest you look at his post for more details. </p>

<h1>Host any static site with GitHub Pages</h1>
<p><em>Jan 26, 2015</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is pretty awesome. It provides free, no-hassle hosting for static sites built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it also has some limitations.</p>
<p>For example, although Jekyll &quot;supports&quot; tags, you can&#39;t create pages to list all posts with a given tag. At least not without using a plugin, which GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t allow.</p>
<p>There is an easy way around this. You can build the site locally (using any plugins or code you want) and still host it on GitHub Pages. It&#39;s pretty simple although there are a few caveats. </p>

<h1>20 of my favourite cooking photos</h1>
<p><em>Nov 7, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I started learning to cook in September 2011. I really enjoyed it. I learned from my Mum, from books and from my own mistakes. </p>
<p>I started taking photographs of what I was making in early 2012. Since then, I have built up a collection of 550 cooking photos of new and interesting recipes. Unfortunately many of the early photos were taking with my Nexus One camera and are pretty much unusable. However, I still have plenty worth sharing, here are my 20 favourite cooking photos. </p>

<h1>My 10 best Tenerife photos</h1>
<p><em>Oct 31, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>In March of this year, I went on a family holiday with my parents to Tenerife. It was fantastic, one of the best holidays we have ever had. </p>
<p>That was also around the time I was getting into photography. I had just bought a second hand Fujifilm X10 and this was the first chance I had to really use it. I wanted to share some of my favourite photos. I&#39;ve probably got about 50 very good ones but that&#39;s too many for one blog post. So, here are my 10 best Tenerife photos.</p>

<h1>MCTS in Texas Hold &#x27;em Poker: A retrospective</h1>
<p><em>Oct 29, 2014</em></p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I&#39;ve recently been uploading a lot of my old projects. Both to prove I&#39;ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.</p>
<p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold &#39;em poker-bot</strong> which uses the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>. In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and make notes on how I could have done better.</p>
