<h1>A third attempt at Anki</h1>
<p><em>Aug 22, 2014</em></p>

<div>
<p>I first found out about <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> ages ago. Probably about four years ago on <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong</a>. It&#39;s a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. </p>
<p>A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. </p>

<h2 id="my-first-attempt">My first attempt</h2>
<p>About three years ago, I decided to give it a try. At the time, I wanted to learn the Java standard library better. I remember installing it and looking for shared decks. There were quite a lot but most were not very good. It felt like most were created by students taking &quot;Introduction to Java&quot; classes. Despite that, I downloaded them anyway. I tried to use them but I lost interest pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I abandoned Anki for the first time. I feel the mistakes I made here are pretty obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the cards were either too easy, too trivial or just not useful</li>
<li>I did not <em>fully</em> understand the content of the Anki cards before trying to learn from them</li>
<li>Although I made a few of my own cards, I never got into the <em>habit</em> of making them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-second-attempt">My second attempt</h2>
<p>About a year and a half ago, I wanted to try it again. I had learned from my previous attempt. I knew that I had to make my own cards instead of using existing ones. </p>
<p>I got into the habit of finding a tutorial on a subject I wanted to learn about and writing notes on the important points. I would then go through my notes and make Anki cards. </p>
<p>This worked better than before but it didn&#39;t last. Although I stuck with it for a good few months, the approach still had many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasted too much time trying to make the cards look pretty (e.g. surrounding all code in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags)</li>
<li>I found that when reading &quot;introductory&quot; tutorials, my cards were often too basic and should have been combined into a smaller number of cards</li>
<li>I only created cards in designated study sessions and never when I was in the middle of programming</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="this-time-will-be-different">This time will be different</h2>
<p>I&#39;m determined to get Anki to work for me. I have read many good things about it and I believe it could be great if only I could start using it better. </p>
<p>I recently found <a href="http://rs.io/2014/04/05/Anki-10000-cards-later.html">this article by someone who has created 10,000 Anki cards</a>. I recommend reading it but here is the advice I took from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Why&quot; questions are more important than memorising facts (this feels obvious yet all my previous efforts had been focused on creating factual cards)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t just create one-way connections, sometimes you need to remember something when given different prompts</li>
<li>There is no need to create multiple decks, one massive deck is just fine</li>
<li>Images can be better than plain text</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-guidelines-for-myself">Some guidelines for myself</h2>
<p>Specifically, here is what I plan to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review <em>every single day</em> and <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#when-to-review">whenever it is most convenient for myself</a></li>
<li>Make an Anki card whenever I learn something <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#how-much-to-add">worth remembering</a></li>
<li>Avoid creating too many purely factual cards or cards with little value</li>
<li>Use a single massive deck and sync it with my Android phone</li>
</ul>
<p>I could write more about this but I think I just need to start. I will create another post in a month or so with my progress. </p>
