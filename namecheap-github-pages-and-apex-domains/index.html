        <p>When I was setting up this blog, I was excited to learn that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">GitHub Pages runs on a fast Content Delivery Network</a>.
          But there is a problem. It does not work with apex domains (i.e. <a href="http://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a>          instead of <a href="http://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>).</p>
        <!--more-->

        <p>Well, it doesn&#39;t work with apex domains on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>          (which I had already registered with). But it does work on other services
          like <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>. This really annoyed
          me. </p>
        <p>As I saw it, there were three possibilities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a &quot;www&quot; subdomain</li>
          <li>Switch to DNSimple</li>
          <li>Don&#39;t take advantage of GitHub&#39;s CDN</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I really wanted to stick with <a href="http://davidxmoody.com/">davidxmoody.com</a>          instead of <a href="http://www.davidxmoody.com/">www.davidxmoody.com</a>.
          There are arguments <a href="http://www.yes-www.org/">for</a> and <a href="http://no-www.org/">against</a>          using &quot;www&quot;. For a simple blog, I feel that not using it is
          far superior. </p>
        <p>I could have switched to DNSimple (or one of the few other services which
          could do the same thing). That would be complicated though. I&#39;m also
          very very happy with Namecheap in every other way.</p>
        <p>It would also be more expensive because DNSimple requires a &quot;membership&quot;
          fee in addition to the cost for registering each domain name. I estimated
          that Namecheap would cost me £8 yearly whereas DNSimple would cost me
          £31 yearly. Also, if you want more than two domains, DNSimple requires
          $80 yearly for Silver membership instead of the $30 for Bronze. That pushes
          the price way up and given that Namecheap was already working well for
          me, I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it. </p>
        <p>In the end, I went for option number three. My blog does not currently use
          GitHub&#39;s CDN. It&#39;s still pretty quick so I don&#39;t really mind.</p>
        <p>Besides, this idea of using <code>ALIAS</code> records to point an apex
          domain to another domain is still relatively new. DNSimple have had it
          for <a href="http://blog.dnsimple.com/2011/11/introducing-alias-record/">about two and a half years</a>          and CloudFlare only added <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-CNAME-Flattening-RFC-compliant-support-for-CNAME-at-the-root">CNAME Flattening earlier this year</a>.
          I would be surprised if Namecheap doesn&#39;t add something similar in
          the next couple of years. I can wait for it. </p>
